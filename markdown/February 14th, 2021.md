        1. FYI "Defined [a new Epic]([[Epics/Establish and document baseline RC conventions and workflows]]) to encapsulate the meta-projects around building the RC." {{or:[[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] | [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] | [[@[[Everyone]]]] | [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] | [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] | [[@[[leekeifon]]]]}}
        2. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) ["Twitter acct"](((DweiIynrD))) 
            - So we could prob just make an @roam_collective account, and use that. (Pending availability).
I'll have a look this week. #[[Follow Up]]
                - {{[[TODO]]}} Look into Twitter handles. [*]([[Brandon Toner]])  #[[February 2021]]

            - The problem is that that creates a big complex page. I prefer the dropdown for sure. 
                - It also mess with the personal queries, adding a result for every permutation of that complex page created.
                - The ease with the dropdown is using the [smartblock](#42SmartBlock .rcNotify ‚Äî @Everyone Tag)!

        4. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) On ["Funky dropdowns"](((IQm5ksecG)))
            - haha, that's due to the italics in the new block ref CSS... I kinda like it too. Was an unintended consequence. 
        5. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) What's the ref on [this](((V-5pe7Vgp)))? 
            - PS love your idea of distributing the Welcome page rather than the home (DNP)! [*](((V1hE4LRf3)))
        6. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) On [Maps of Meaning book](((fDjAaI9Ll)))
            - I own it! It is a full blown textbook haha. A monster. 
            - Intimidates the hell out of me, but finally feel ready to dive into it (especially the diagrams) since finishing up the lecture series.
            - Also thinking on jumping back into [[Hero of a Thousand Faces]] and [[Sam Marfleet]]'s study guide soon. Lots of overlapping themes. 
        7. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) EXCELLENT use of "Drafts" [here](((d3Zz5irPl)))!! Exactly what I imagine for that tag. 
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        1. Added some [queries](((-iIUy3zDF))) to assist in detecting and picking up with "work to be done" on active sprints.
        2. Added some "Next Steps" on the current sprint.
        3. "Defined [a new Epic]([[Epics/Establish and document baseline RC conventions and workflows]]) to encapsulate the meta-projects around building the RC."

            - I chatted with the developer about roam games as his extension queries all the info that it's required for the dependency deduction.
        - [@B]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [cc:C]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])The page did not look like [this](((09YoL_11j))) when I made it. Check again.

        - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [This is cool](((yez0IRTC_))), but it's just as easy and less verbose to edit if you write it as {{or: [[@[[Everyone]]]] | [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] | [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] | [[@[[Peter Rosso]]]] | [[@[[leekeifon]]]] | [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]] | [[@[[Samuel Bars]]]] }}
`[@[[[Everyone]]]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]],[[@[[Everyone]]]],[[@[[Charles Farr]]]],[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]],[[@[[leekeifon]]]],[[@[[Larissa de Lima]])`
        - [@B]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [@C]([[^[[Charles Farr]]]]) This is far more articulated than what we said on the call. Loving it. If the process brings them to answer a personal question or creating their first evergreen notes it would increase their sense of self esteem. ((Get those endorphins running am I right?)) [...]
            - What if we structured it in sessions. These sessions are todos in the DNP so that people can add things like the examples that you guys gave as todos in their personal section. 
            - Also, we could create a DNP called welcome? that has a welcome message and points people to the right resources in the right order. This feels redundant but thought I'd write it anyways. 
        - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [On "recovering Twitter account"](((cNxFQnwKF))) Good luck it may take ages and they might want money for it. It's worth asking and hopes good people. Additionally, you can always change your Twitter handle. As long as people don't write it on paper or on websites we can start populating one with crazy content.
        - [@B]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [On Maps of Meaning](((6Lx8NA4n_))) There is also a book!
