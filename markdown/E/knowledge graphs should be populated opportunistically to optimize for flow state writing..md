    - Notes:: 
        - Within a knowledge graph, there are a lot of paths that could be taken to populate content and "fill out" the graph. To keep it fun and engaging, and to optimize [[productivity]], populate the graph [[opportunistically]]. Take the path you are most [[inspired]] to take.
        - The exception to this is the population of essential structure and time-sensitive projects. Prioritize what needs to be done first, and apply this principle within those constraints. 
        - Clear targets, [[objectives]], direction, and [[goals]] help to keep the direction of graph development in alignment with the community [[purpose]].
