        - [[active resurfacing]] is a more [[reliable]] method of resurfacing. It involves the use of time-anchored events resurface blocks.
            - Methods of active resurfacing:
                - Reminders
                - Use of time-based [[rituals]] (scheduled reviews)
                - Tagging someone in it
        - [[passive resurfacing]] relies on [[serendipity]] or [[context]] to resurface blocks.
            - Methods of passive resurfacing:
                - Ensuring that [notes are densely linked]([[[[E:]] Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]).
                - Use of flags to sort content by relevance.
                    - E.g. `#Bookmarks`
                - Proper use of the [[DNP Modules]].
                    - Facilitates more effective querying.
                - Use of context-based [[rituals]].
    - Next Steps::
        - Reorganize content (feels choppy)
        - Elaborate on the various methods of passive resurfacing
