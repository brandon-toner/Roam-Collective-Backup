        - **Welcome to Roam Collective!** 😃 
            - Once you create you personal page using the [Personal Page Template](((8BBipopP5))), customize your pre-made Daily Notes Template with your name (instead of this one)
        - **Tips:**
        - Write some thoughts under your **scratchpad** block
        - Comment on something in the graph under your **conversation** block
        - Capture some initial feedback in your **feedback** block
        - #Scratchpad ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas)) #not-populated
            - __write here__
        - #[[Conversation & Comments]] ((This is where the magic happens. Block reference the block you want to comment or reply to, then nest your reply beneath the reference.)) #not-populated
            - __comment/reply here__
                - **Instructions:** __Block reference blocks from elsewhere in the graph & nest comments underneath them__
        - #[[Feedback & Questions]] ((A place to log feedback and questions related to the graph)) #not-populated
