                    - How do you navigate at a company? You go to the person that knows everyone. Analogy to an [[index]].
                    - Important to understand the [[entry points]] & [[hubs]]
                - [[Jason Griffing]]
                    - A lot of us think in [[outline]] form

                    - Uses queries as a way to teach himself where to look
                    - [Queries]([[querying]]) on [[compound tags]] and [[tag combinations]]
                    - A query is a [[translation]] layer â€” working to aggregate what Rob places into his graph
            - [[Robert Haisfield]]
                - Think of pages as collections; block references as threads
