        - #I Create a #[[temp-queries]] tag to append to blocks with queries used "just for today"
            - Goal: prevent database from slowing down due to too many queries
                - #Q Is [this](((yVLz9g3wg))) a risk?
            - Make that tag invisible to reduce [[visual noise]]
        - #I Another strategy to "Goal: prevent database from slowing down due to too many queries" is to utlilize **smartblock buttons**
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Write a process for [[weekly review]]
            - Review TODOs tagged with any **past weeks** tags (e.g. [[Week-07: 02-15-2021]])
                - Adjust the date tag
                - Add the task to the backlog as a project / epic
                - Remove the task
            - Include a description of how to use the [[Date Planner]] to manage tasks.
        - #FN The [[Date Planner]] serves as a [[tickler file]] with different levels of [[granularity]].
            - Blocks can be tagged with days, weeks, or months to be included into daily, weekly, and monthly reviews respectively. 
                - This is particularly helpful for managing TODOs
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Create a set of questions (an algorithm of thought almost) to assess TODOs with. #GTD #[[task management]] #productivity #[[project management]]
            - Is this the next action?
            - What contexts are associated with this action?
            - Is this actually a project or an epic?
            - Who is this relevant to?

        3. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) ‚Äî FYI when running the DNP Header template, it needs to be done as a **smartblock** to properly render some of the components.

        3. Made a change to the [[Roam42]] code to resolve a bug ‚Äî you'll have to re-enable the code block.  {{or: [[@[[Everyone]]]] | [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] | [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] | [[@[[Peter Rosso]]]] | [[@[[leekeifon]]]] | [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]] | [[@[[Samuel Bars]]]] }}
