    - #Scratchpad
        - On processing ideas, questions, hypotheses, etc.
            - Mirroring the need for note maturity is the need to easily identify how ideas, questions, and all other atomic knowledge units are being processed through the graph
                - Major for each type:
                    - 1) the final output
                    - 2) the process
                    - 3) the stages of development
            - Processing status and maturity are not analogous, but they are tightly intertwined
