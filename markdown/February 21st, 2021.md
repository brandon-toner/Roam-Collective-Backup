            - Swap author with package to have a package centric dependency tree. If you embed the section of the tree of each package mentioned on its page then they can nominate more ancestors and that page/relation gets included in the graph
            - If the tweet address is supplied this should be automatable ((provided submission are already in the graph))
                - On top this could propagate down the reshare path to see if there are further ancestors nominated

    - #Scratchpad 
        - Doing a bit of brainstorming/data population in [the Agora](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/The-Roaman-Agora) today ‚Äî mapping the Roam Games and roamcult projects & tools more broadly.
            - Would love some help in mapping the territory ‚Äî **the more brainstormers the better**. (I'm bound to forget most things)
                - To help: 
                    - Brainstorm a list of: SUBMISSIONS, OTHER PROJECTS/TOOLS, and COMPANION TOOLS
                        - Can either do that here or in the Agora.
                    - Create placeholder submission pages for past, and present RoamGames projects. Don't worry too much about accuracy here... the project contributors can always take over to improve the information.
                        - #I We could put a banner at the top of the page for each placeholder submission ‚Äî as a disclaimer that we are populating it and that there may be inaccuracies.
                            - With a CTA to let the project team know to update their section in the Agora.
        - #Obs I'm feeling a lot of ideas/opportunities slip through my fingers...
            - #I Start adding ideas to the [[Backlog]] page. [cc:Charles]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])

        1. Updated [my personal DNP template](((VyS8OjXZx))) to include a set of queries for [[block-level tags]]. 
            - A query now populates, automatically collecting any mentions of key block-level tags within my section.
            - Key aspects:
                - DATEBASIS = DNP to allow for populating my template in-advance for the next day.
                - CONCAT function to prevent the queries from being created WITHIN the template block. (they would be big and slow)
                - DATE:today to auto-populate the correct day for the queries upon population.
            - Image::

        2. Added Zettelkasten and TODO summaries to the Community Notes section (series of queries)
            - Rationale:: Compile results from the full DNP (across users)
        3. Added a Change Log query to the Community Notes section
