        - On Graph [[CSS]] settings [¬∞]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]])
            - To modularize the CSS, the best way seems to be to decouple variables for general color and then for coloring specific objects. In practice, that looks like this.
                - CSS block with color variables ‚Üí see: "Red"
                - CSS block with variables for specific features ‚Üí see: "Tags"
            - Then, for the `color:` attribute for tags either uses the standard variable (e.g., `var(--bg-tag)`) or a specific color variable (e.g., `var(--cl-red-900)`).
            - Specifically for your question [here](((OyHWMqBxC))) Brandon, most tags would use the `var(--bg-tag)`, representing the standard __tag background__.
                - You could also create additional tag categories, such as for DNP tags (`var(--cl-dnp-tags)`).
            - To your question [here](((1uVLjCSgJ))) Brandon, I am sure there are some best practices related to coding. [¬∞]([[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]])
                - By creating and using [[variables]], you limit the complexity and allow for easily updating the graph. For instance, all you need to do to change the shade of red is to change all of the `--cl-red-x00` variables, or to change all of the standard tags, edit the `--bg-tag` variable.
                    - Good [example]([[Example]]) of [[modularity]] and the power of [[abstractions]]
        - Simple Replies

            - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) one element of your `#[[Fleeting Notes]]` that always trips me up is the capitalization...
                - Re: "#[[therefore]] #[[FN]] the use of [[block-level tags]] for annotating [[statement chains]] improves the quality of ones [[thinking]] and [[writing]]."
                    - If I were to rephrase this (using my css), it would look like...
                    - #Notion The use of block-level tags for annotating statement chains improves the quality of ones thinking & writing
                        - You could pair this with some fancy #therefore css...
                    - #therefore "#Notion The use of block-level tags for annotating statement chains improves the quality of ones thinking & writing"
                        - Using this approach leads to better separation between the constituent parts of the block-level tag...
                            - You can easily parse out...
                                1. The [[prepositional linkages]]
                                2. The type of note (Notion)

                            - It would be easy to implement similar CSS with the `#[[Fleeting Notes]]` tag...
                                - See: Version 2
                    - #[[FN]] CSS for [[block-level tags]] should allow for easy [[parsing]] of the constituent parts; adding visuals cues allows for easier and more rapid processing of block contents.
            - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) I like the idea of using `#FN`: "OR EVEN simplify down to `#FN` and `#LN` as block level tags... [*]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])"
