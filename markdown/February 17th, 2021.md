        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Annotating writing and literature with [[block-level tags]], fosters a consideration of the structure of [[narratives]].
            - [[therefore]] #[[Fleeting Notes]] the use of [[block-level tags]] for annotating [[statement chains]] improves the quality of ones [[thinking]] and [[writing]].
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] the use [prepositional linkages]([[[[E:]] prepositional linkages]]) 
                - #Obs [[statement chains]] feels off, because lines of [[logic]] involve more than [[statements]].

            - "{{[[DONE]]}} [[Choice]]: For [[evergreen notes]], what should the [[namespaces]] be? ((((cv2ny1Xe-)))) "
                - I really want to be able to link an evergreen note, and them to turn green due to the collapsing namespaces. (the color feels like another **tier** of link)
                - Burying the page names in an alias is kinda annoying.
