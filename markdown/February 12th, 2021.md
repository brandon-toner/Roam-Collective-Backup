    - #Scratchpad 
        - [[[[Q:]] How could an "[[agile]]" approach to collaboration be implemented in Roam Collective?]]
        - Thoughts:: `Work Summary` attribute
            - Purpose: to orient team members working on the question/sprint/epic
            - A place to log/link to related work elsewhere in the database.
            - #Q How do you prevent the need to duplicate the log in several places in the graph?
                - Solution:: Block embeds.
                    - Work done on questions and sprints are embedded on their relevant epics. 
                        - Example:: [here](((fPjw916JP)))
                    - Work on pages related to a sprint are embedded on the sprint.
        - Feeling the need for some other block-level tag like "observation" maybe...
            - Right now, I use Q and I â€” but I'd like to be able to log simple observations
                - These could be statements/problems about the way things are. 
                - This would serve as an important anchor for driving the dialogue between A and A.
            - Proposed workflow:
                - Make **observation**
                - Phrase as **question**
                    - Document Q-pages as they arise.
                - Come up with some related **ideas**
                    - Document FN, SDL, etc as they arise. 
                - Cycles naturally through these, inviting collaboration as necessary.
            - Testing it out: #Obs
    - #[[The Zettelkasten]] #not_populated
    - #Bookmarks #not_populated
    - #Conversation #not_populated
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        1. Upgraded [Charles]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])' block-level question on agile to page-level. Lots of ideas around that lately.
