    - #Scratchpad 
        - Added page: [[[[Q:]] How could an "agile" approach to collaboration be implemented in Roam Collective?]]
        - Thoughts:: `Work Summary` attribute[*]([[[[Q:]] How could an "agile" approach to collaboration be implemented in Roam Collective?]])
            - Purpose: to orient team members working on the question/sprint/epic
            - A place to log/link to related work elsewhere in the database.
            - #Q How do you prevent the need to duplicate the log in several places in the graph?
                - Solution:: Block embeds.
                    - Work done on questions and sprints are embedded on their relevant epics. 
                        - Example:: [here](((fPjw916JP)))
                    - Work on pages related to a sprint are embedded on the sprint.
        - Feeling the need for some other block-level tag like "observation" maybe...
            - Right now, I use Q and I â€” but I'd like to be able to log simple observations
                - These could be statements/problems about the way things are. 
                - This would serve as an important anchor for driving the dialogue between A and A.
            - Proposed workflow:
                - Make **observation**
                - Phrase as **question**
                    - Document Q-pages as they arise.
                - Come up with some related **ideas**
                    - Document FN, SDL, etc as they arise. 
                - Cycles naturally through these, inviting collaboration as necessary.
            - Testing it out: #Obs
        - [[Mat McGann]]'s "9 Things I Learned" while running his startup in a multiplayer graph.
            1. Dedicate a Roam graph to team work.
            2. Add content directly in the right context.
            3. Use Daily Notes as output.
            4. Write down everything.
            5. Write down only once.
            6. Use tags and notifications sparingly.
            7. Spend time tweaking custom CSS.
            8. Embrace the messiness of a graph.
            9. Roam's upsides make up for its downsides.
        - Thoughts:: [[namespaces]]
            - Two types:
                - Nested Links
                - Native slash-style
            - Comments::
                - A page can only have ONE namespace. 
                    - These can be nested hierarchically, but it's very [[file-folder]]-y
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[namespaces]] should be reserved for pages with a clear categorization.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A `Tags::` attribute can be used to designate [[collections]] and sub-collections, using a combination of tags.
                - Why I'm thinking about this:
                    - Is something a resource or a roam game submission? Can it be both?
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A test for strength of [[conventions]]: Are categories [[mutually-exclusive]] when a categorization decision is necessary?
            - #Q What conventions should be [[mutually-exclusive]]? 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] conventions with overlap in utility or lack-of-clarity of use should be flagged as `#Tensions` to allow for re-evaluation and resolution.
        - Thoughts:: [[agile development]] ([Sprints]([[sprints]]), [Epics]([[epics]]), etc) [*]([[Processes]])[*]([[Outlines]])[*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])[*]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]])[*]([[Drafts]])[*]([[Bookmarks]])
            - **Building on:** [Charles' work on agile in Roam](((74aPTS1FT)))
            - Epics = big picture surrounding a meaningful question.
            - Really, a Roam Games question feels big enough in scope for an Epic, but the time-frame pushes it to feel more at-home as a sprint.
                - Maybe this addresses [this](((RJj8IZlGp)))[*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])
            - [Epics]([[epics]]) = the thing to be developed/answered/accomplished
            - [Sprints]([[sprints]]) = the unit of work
            - Here's the workflow I imagine: ((okkkk this might be a marathon haha))
                1. Explore ideas loosely in the form of the various options for tags (Q, I, Obs, FN, EN)
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [These tags](((foYwq0l3e))) (in combination with page links for keywords) provide a framework to labelling the meandering thoughts â€”Â allowing ideas to persist across time and related ideas to accumulate.
                2. Once work starts to center around some common [[themes]], [[questions]] and [[ideas]], they could start to take the form of a defined "[epic]([[epics]])".
                    - An [epic]([[epics]]) is an objective centered around an open question or development milestone. [*]([[Definitions]])
                3. The epic should be formed using the [epic template](((Gx7UUAS7L))), and information on the template should be populated to gather all relevant information in one place.
                    - This becomes the hub of the mission.
                4. Epics are big though... sometimes they can feel too big or overwhelming to tackle. This is where [[sprints]] come in.
                    - Sprints are the manageable units of work associated with an epic.[*]([[Definitions]])
                    - Related:: [[[[E:]] How do you eat an elephant?]]
                5. Sprints are formed to break epics into manageable pieces. These should be populated using the [sprints template](((tG1HJs2dK)))
                6. Sprints and epics should be easily visible on the daily notes page each day â€” giving users the ability to see at-a-glance what the group is converging around. 
                7. Work related to sprints should be conducted within each user's DNP Section & referenced into the [Work Summary section](((JZ6S734y4))), as a rolling log of work completed by all team members.
                8. As work accumulates, members (or a sprint leader) should then review the bits of work, **assembling the pieces into a summary document**. This is the [deliverable]([[deliverables]]) of the sprint.  
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] By breaking down epics into [[intermediate packets]] or [[intermediate deliverables]] (as phrased by [Conor]([[Conor White-Sullivan]])), collaboration, the remixing of work, and the management of [[dependencies]] becomes easier.[*](((RyuMSELI3)))
                        - #Seedlings Breaking down work into intermediate packets improves collaboration, agility, and dependency management. 
                9. Once a sprint is adequately completed, the team can then move to the next priority component of the epic. 
                10. Repeat.
        - Conversation with Charles:
            - Epic = question
            - Sprint = group of tasks, the work
            - Story points = outline of components of the epic
        - Prepositional Linkages
            - [[[[E:]] Claim 1]]
            - [[[[E:]] Claim 2]]

        - @Peter on `Obs` vs `Ob`
            - [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) [on "Ob" vs "Obs"](((7TT80uRn7))): I think "Obs" is the standard abbreviation for "Observation" or "Observed"
            - "[@Brandon]([[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [on "Ob" vs "Obs"](((iEONmm8aD))) If it's a standard then I think it's perfect. It's good to have an "element" for each collection, but does this increase the chance of having too many collection tags? I like the idea, I am just worried about the structure becoming too complex for no reason."
                - It's not a required tag by any means, and not an essential part of any collaborative structure. "[Beneficial, but optional]([[[[E:]] beneficial, but optional]])"... so it's more a take-it-or-leave it kinda convention. (Not worried about over-complexity here)
        - [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) On messaging conventions [*](((HeW5OoT_5)))
            -  Yea, I like it. Particularly the @[name]. I find it a bit more natural to toss the ref in an alias or in context some times â€” but that's nothing that needs to be universal in style. As long as its there is the main thing to converge on as a group.
            - It also brings up the idea of using [@Everyone]([[@[[Everyone]]]]) as a universal notification place... [*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]]), [*]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]])
                - Of course, this inbox couldn't be cleared, but it could serve as a rolling inbox for people to check in on periodically. 
                - Not sure if @ or cc would be best... probably @ for higher priority/request for input, cc for lower as usual. 
                    - You'll be less likely to *get* input unless people have the habit of checking that inbox... which is a bit labour intensive, but I donno.
                    - I still prefer the top-section "Chat" for elevation. This could be used in combo no problem, though. It's non-destructive.
        - On [Charles' personal system](((vxaP_RzP-))):[*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])
            - "`#Obs` / `#Observations` â€” summarizing literature or resources in one or multiple concise statements"
                - Ha! [Same tag](((cxK_gynrp))) â€” different use context... 
                    - I'm conceptualizing Obs/Observations as being much more broad than __observations on specific literature__.
            - "`#Syn` / `[[S:]]` pages â€” new synthesized "evergreen" thoughts"
                - I like this in a personal system, or one focused on the synthesis of knowledge in a research-like approach â€” but I think Evergreen is appropriate in RC as it is more broad in definition. (concepts and claims, rather than just claims)
                    - I do think that claims could be further sub-tagged in the EN structure though. Addition of a `#Claims` tag would suit here for more "synthesis notes"
            - "`#Q` / `#Questions` / `[[Q:]]` â€” my knowledge graph is organized around answering one or multiple questions; essentially, questions are output oriented..."
                - Similar to existing RC conventions.
            - "`#Collection` â€” general purpose speculative outlines that organize around a topic or concept, not a central question"
                - Feels too close in name to "Collections" as a type of tag in general. But would work well in a personal graph.
            - "`#Notion` â€” "a general understanding;" "vague or imperfect conception or idea of something;" "an opinion, view, or belief;" a general "conception or idea" â€” [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/notion)"
                - This is intriguing â€” I'm thinking the role of a Notion note would be satisfied by the space around FN and SDL
                    - Level of [[uncertainty]] could be eventually captured with a **confidence level** attribute.
        - [@Charles]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]]) I haven't yet been able to grok the proposed structure [here](((67jhmzS6u))) 
            - Working through it, gradually. & working to intergrate your thoughts into the templates [here](((tG1HJs2dK))) and [here](((Gx7UUAS7L))).
            - Stories is the part that I haven't been able to work in yet â€” feels too zoomed in maybe? Sprints are already pretty high-res. I think I conceptualize stories as  being outlines on an epic that are worked upon during a sprint. I don't find the "user stories" metaphor clicks with me at all haha
            - My thoughts continued more centrally located [here]"Thoughts:: [[agile development]] ([Sprints]([[sprints]]), [Epics]([[epics]]), etc) [*]([[Processes]])[*]([[Outlines]])[*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])[*]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]])[*]([[Drafts]])[*]([[Bookmarks]])"
