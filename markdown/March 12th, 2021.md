- #[[Community Notes]] [[Roam-Collective]] {{word-count}} [*]([[rc]])
    - #[[Main Feed]] ((A place to showcase graph highlights throughout the day)) #not-populated
    - #[[Graph Change Log]]

Shifted from using `#[[Change Log]]` to `#[[Graph Change Log]]`, and to placing updates directly into the `[[Community Notes]]` section. (Like this)
            - Rationale::
                - Disambiguates between changes to other things, like projects. 
                - Centralizes updates across users without needing to review linked references.
                - Reinforces the [[community notes]] as a singular place to go for highlights on the graph (Announcements, Main Feed, and Graph Change Log)
