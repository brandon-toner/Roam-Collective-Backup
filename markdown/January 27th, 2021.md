    - Change in [convention]([[Conventions]])! [[Chat]]
        - From `[[@]][[Brandon Toner]]` to `[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]` ([[complex page names]]) — **note that the CSS box should wrap the name**
        - Can now "**save**" a notification by changing to a `^` "Mark the notification as "read" by changing `@` to `~`, or "save" the message by changing to a `^` "

- #[[My Daily Notes]] [[Brandon Toner]] {{word-count}} [*]([[bnt]])
    - #Scratchpad
        - #Tips
            - Use the #Tensions tag to flag areas of conflict without clear resolution.
        - #Observations
            - Just noted that if you change a block that has been referenced, it can make the chat history less read-able. 
                - #[[Q]] How could we preserve the chat integrity as the blocks they reference change?
        - #Questions
            - How could we build a convention for "waiting for reply"? 
                - [[i.e.]] you tag someone in a chat and it is still unread.
                - May need a From:Brandon type page to include in a query
                    - [[e.g.]] `[[From[[Brandon Toner]]]]` AND `[[@]]` 
                        - Don't love it yet, but it might be on the right track. Feels like a lot of work? Maybe not though. I'd rather the "from" information be implied by it's place in the graph... [[i.e.]] nested under your DNP section under Comments might work. 
            - How do we improve [[Chat]] conventions so that we avoid the "[shouting as you run by](((R9BCN_mmu)))" feeling? 
        - I'd like to come up with some topic tags...
            - Collaboration
            - Chat
            - Project Management
            - Multiplayer
            - ... There is a lot of overlap in terms. Having some set topic tags could help us to compile information by category - improving the ease of review.
            - I can even see this extending into other niche topics like:
                - Roam Medical
                - Writing
                - And other interest subjects...
            - The aim is that you could either FILTER IN or FILTER OUT topics to focus you experience with the graph.
        - [[Projects/Establish automated graph backups]]
        - `#how-should-I-tag-this` (resolved) [[Evergreens/Start from abundance]]
            - This is [[David Perell]]'s articulation of this idea... 
            - If it were MY idea, It would be an [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]]).
                - `#[[Open Questions]]` How should I represent the ideas of others? (resolved)
                    - Actually... since this is [[multiplayer]] - there are MANY authors of [[evergreen notes]]! So I think make this an EN, with [[David Perell]] as the author.
        - On the use of tags & [[tag proliferation]]
            - I see tags as “optional but beneficial”

Nothing “breaks” if they are not used, but as more people use shared conventions, there are benefits in usability and convergence.

So, I’d say “if you know the convention, use it — if you don’t, rely on context” #Tips

            - Process:
                - Capture assertions as [["N"-notes]] (atomic ideas, succinct)
                - Capture ideas from resources (articles, videos, books) as [[literature notes]] (the authors' assertions)
                - Turn assertions into [[evergreen notes]] once they feel sufficiently (arbitrarily) mature and widely applicable.

                - "I agree with" "here is some supporting information/references..." "I disagree..." etc. 
                    - Perhaps this is a great place to use some of the rhetoric arguments we were thinking about defining... [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]
        - #Conventions relevant [[tags]] should be appended to any [["N"-notes]] to promote effective [[convergence]]. #zettelkasten

            - #[[N]] [[inline code-blocks]] can be used to "deactivate" a tag, preventing it from appearing in queries or references.
                - This is. helpful when demonstrating the **use of a tag** when you don't want to muddy up the references.
            - #[[N]][[literature notes]] should be [[atomic]] and [[concise]] in nature. Only one idea or concept per literature note. #zettelkasten [*](((7nHVatWGu)))
            - #[[N]] [["N"-notes]] far outnumber [[literature notes]] and [[permanent notes]] in quantity. It take an accumulation of [["N"-notes]] before more mature and original ideas take form.
                - The [[evergreen notes]] [[metaphor]] works better here. 
                    - [[seedlings]] are the base-ideas. The "seeds" of more mature thought. These accumulate and grow connections until they can mature into [[evergreen notes]].

                - [[Evergreens/Start from abundance]] — [[David Perell]]
        - My Zettelkasten Workflow imported from [[[[Roam Book Club]] II]] #zettelkasten
            - [[consume]] & [[engage]]: (read, watch, listen, converse, reflect)
            - As content resonates with me, I save them as [[reference notes]] (capturing [[context]] — [[bibliographical notes]], [[highlights]], and [[quotes]]) #capture
            - As my wanderings inspire thoughts and ideas, I save those ideas as [["N"-notes]].
                - These are statements written inline with my notes. [["N"-notes]] are **the first tier of notes worth documenting** in my [[interpretation]].
                - I keep the `originals` of these notes in a designated place. I keep a copy of the reference [[inline]] to preserve the context of where the note originated. 
                    - Example:: "#[[N]] The power of a [collaborative graph database]([[Multiplayer Roam]]) improves with the degree of alignment with key [[conventions]]. Data needs to be compiled in order to [compound]([[compounding]])."
                - [[supporting information]] is nested underneath the original block. As a block reference if necessary to preserve context of the related idea.
                    - These are [[context snippets]] in [[Joel Chan]]'s [[interpretation]]
                - [[tags]] may be added inline at the end of the note or nested underneath to aid in [[connection]] and [[resurfacing]].
                - When adding new [["N"-notes]] to my [[zettelkasten]], if they feel relevant to several different areas of the zettelkasten, I will create a [[reference]] to nest it underneath the other related note(s). 
                    - More commonly, I just create them in context and rely on references for convergence and patterns.
            - For content that I consider worth summarizing (the author makes great points that I would love to reference later in my own writing/ideas) — I form `#Literature Notes` #[[literature notes]]
                - These are core concept summaries. They are **the author's ideas** phrased **in my own words**. They should be [[concise]] and [[atomic]] in nature. **Only one idea or concept per literature note**.
            - As both [["N"-notes]] and [[literature notes]] accumulate, [[patterns]] emerge and my [[opinions]] embolden. When it feels like I can form a [permanent note]([[permanent notes]]) on the subject, I create one.
            - As [[project ideas]] arise through different stages of the workflow, I add them to a section of my [[zettelkasten]] called `[[Project Ideas]]`.
                - Over time, I link ideas that may be related to the project by referencing them as a [[nested block]].
                - Once a clear outline has formed, or enough [[content]] exists to easily begin [[writing]], **I complete the project and the cycle continues**. 🎉🥂

        - "It's a small thing but could we could shift some of the tags and default template test to make them easier to select? Changing `#not-populated` to `#not_populated` makes it possible to select the text with a single double click in order to delete it when you're ready. [Same thing should extend to any of the 'dummy' text inside templates that's meant to be deleted.](((JCg22PlRk))) Thoughts? [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]"
            - Yup, this is a great idea! 
            - I added the [[roam/js/tag-cycle]] page such that "CTRL+SHIFT+C HASH" removes the not-populated tag as well -- another option.
            - PS, to send a notification, use the @ symbol rather than ~ to indicated "unread" status. When read, you can replace with a ~ to indicate read. [[~]] [[Matthew Vogel]]
        - "Is there discussion/dialogue convention. I see here [⬆️](((HjQ5425kF))), a convention to get your attention. Where are the standards here. I thought I saw it before you did some of the restructuring. [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]"
            - Check out the #Chat page for some conventions. 
            - I'll leave some breadcrumbs on the conventions page as well.
        - "What are the ideas for creating a dashboard for seeing how people are getting your attention. You can't efficiently query at this point using our conventions. If I was to create a query `{{[[query]]: {and: [[@]] [[Mark Robertson]]}}}` I will not get my own `taps`, but instead get the ones that I have created on my DNP. The easy way, but don't know how stable is to add a `{not:}` for each member, but that seems to be an update nightmare.  [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]"
            - Yea, I noticed this the other day as well...
            - If we made complex pages like [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]], that would work. That might be reason enough to switch conventions. DEFINITELY need a way to query for attention tags
        - "One thing that has been clear with all the multiplayer graphs I have worked with, is that zooming in on the bullet/area you are working on CAN be helpful to allow [[Roam]] to more efficiently sync changes AND it eases content moving right before your eyes. - since we will in effect be on different pages, instead of on one. [[~]] [[Brandon Toner]]"
            - Is this captured by this tip? [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] "Click on any bullet to "zoom in" for a more focused perspective (reducing the noise, and focusing on your section) - this also helps with stability if there are a lot of us writing simultaneously."
        - "There is also a disconnect in my mind, because of the nature of this graph's purpose, between what is `[[Feedback]]` and what is a `[[Question]]`. Is there something more specific for the feedback, as in elements that are built and we have feedback on. And question would be pushing the frontiers as well as potential suggestions. [[~]] [[Brandon Toner]]"
            - Yup, I feel this as a [tension]([[Tensions]]) as well...
                - I this "Questions" is more a training thing. Asking for clarity, process, or convention.
                - While #[[[[Feedback]]: [[Suggestions]]]] are suggestions for improvement.
                - Either way works well in the short term, but I think more mutually exclusive distinctions would be helpful for clarity and consolidation. [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]]
            -

            - Ou, yea that's an important difference for sync. 
            - I'll adjust the wording to suggest zooming.
        - "That helps. Explorers will always find the path, and show the way for others. And for builders, sometimes let others determine that paths they would take, before establishing predefined funnels. This is a general observation about building spaces for people. For example, many European nations (particularly Scandinavia) do not build paths through parks and open spaces UNTIL people determine what way they would want to go. [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]"
            - That's a great illustrative example. Love that. Any suggestions on how we might apply that technique to our conventions here? [[
            - That's a great illustrative example. Love that. Any suggestions on how we might apply that technique to our conventions here? [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]]
        - "And what I wanted to say at the [[Clubhouse]] meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [[Roam]] due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - This "shouting while running by" description is great. I feel that.
            - I think preventing that phenomenon and working towards better collaborative systems is in perfect alignment with what I'd like to work on in this space.
        - "[[~]][[Brandon Toner]] Why do you want to use hiccup? use `---`"
            - `---` is WAY better. Using that now.
            - PS, note that I changed the conventions on Chat so that its a nested page. Like this: `[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]` [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
        - "URL:: (Is currently set as private but a public backup could be nice)"
            - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] Public would be better for sure — easy to do? Private is certainly fine for now. 
        - "#[[N]] [[inline code-blocks]] can be used to "deactivate" a tag, preventing it from appearing in queries or references."
            - Fascinating to see this idea documented in [[[[Roam Book Club]] II]] — I forgot I thought of it over there first.
        - "My Zettelkasten Workflow imported from [[[[Roam Book Club]] II]] #zettelkasten"
            - This is a decent summary. Not too outdated. System has been quite stable.

            - Loving the (()) symbol for hiding instructions within templates. 
                - Example::
                    - {{embed: ((qONZuXh3Y))}}
            - Liking the idea of the `#[[Help Wanted]]` tag -- this could be great for teamwork.
        - #[[[[Feedback]]: What could be better]]
            - Chat conventions feel a bit messy confusing. #Conventions
                - I'd like to prevent writing within each other's sections, but stronger processes would be helpful.
                - Block references feel like the right way to go. 
                - I think I prefer `[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]` for sake of queries.

        - Loving some of these tags and their css tweaks. "It's a small thing but could we could shift some of the tags and default template test to make them easier to select?

            - "Explore the idea of chat in a multiplayer graph. Brainstorm ideas on how existing chat conventions might be improved. What does better look like?"
                - Existing chat conventions work for now but can be difficult to find if you don't actively keep the graph open and continue to check mentions. I'm currently working on a plugin that would act as a JS bridge to other chat apps (a slack bot for example). The bridge would send you [[notifications]] of mentions and/or block ref of your created blocks.
                    - It's early days but I've worked up some `:q` [[queries]] that will find people who have referenced blocks of yours that you have yet to see. I'll be creating some kind of notification center within roam first I think. Not sure yet how to tackle notifications when you're away from the roam graph. This may just be something we wait for the full [[Roam API]] for
                    - Need to do some further investigation into all the ideas brought but by [[David Bieber]] [here](((1NzXjSWfB)))
    - #Questions ((about collaboration and beyond)) 
        - Very interested in the shared space between [[Roam]] and [newsletters]([[Newsletter]]). Could people subscribe to certain pages/topics on your roam graph and get a custom newsletter with only the sections that interest them?

        - Is there discussion/dialogue convention. I see here [⬆️](((HjQ5425kF))), a convention to get your attention. Where are the standards here. I thought I saw it before you did some of the restructuring. [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]
            - That helps. Explorers will always find the path, and show the way for others. And for builders, sometimes let others determine that paths they would take, before establishing predefined funnels. This is a general observation about building spaces for people. For example, many European nations (particularly Scandinavia) do not build paths through parks and open spaces UNTIL people determine what way they would want to go. [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]
    - #Feedback ((share your comments about the experience, click on the feedback tag for more info)) 
        - And what I wanted to say at the [[Clubhouse]] meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [[Roam]] due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]
        - One thing that has been clear with all the multiplayer graphs I have worked with, is that zooming in on the bullet/area you are working on CAN be helpful to allow [[Roam]] to more efficiently sync changes AND it eases content moving right before your eyes. - since we will in effect be on different pages, instead of on one. [[~]] [[Brandon Toner]]
            - You maybe right with your comment here: "Is this captured by this tip? [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] "Click on any bullet to "zoom in" for a more focused perspective (reducing the noise, and focusing on your section) - this also helps with stability if there are a lot of us writing simultaneously."" . Though I know that Zooming is under-the-hood different, from collapse. Basically collapsing is a change of state, not of page. Where if you zoom in, you are actually on another URL. [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]
        - What are the ideas for creating a dashboard for seeing how people are getting your attention. You can't efficiently query at this point using our conventions. If I was to create a query `{{[[query]]: {and: [[@]] [[Mark Robertson]]}}}` I will not get my own `taps`, but instead get the ones that I have created on my DNP. The easy way, but don't know how stable is to add a `{not:}` for each member, but that seems to be an update nightmare.  [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]
            - Re: "If we made complex pages like [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]], that would work. That might be reason enough to switch conventions. DEFINITELY need a way to query for attention tags". My suggestion in this same block does work, but from what you suggest we may need to find either a JS SmartBlock or easy way to toggle read/unread. [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]]
        - There is also a disconnect in my mind, because of the nature of this graph's purpose, between what is `[[Feedback]]` and what is a `[[Question]]`. Is there something more specific for the feedback, as in elements that are built and we have feedback on. And question would be pushing the frontiers as well as potential suggestions.

    - Good morning everyone here! Brandon, cheers for setting this up, looking forward to seeing what happens here!
    - #Conversation
        - partially in response to: "Explore the idea of chat in a multiplayer graph. Brainstorm ideas on how existing chat conventions might be improved. What does better look like?"
            - This is totally "low hanging fruit" that I feel has been missed, but I honestly I feel like a simple notification system when someone "reacts" to a block with an emoji, after they right click to get the "add reaction" menu, would be one of the simplest, easiest things the development team could do to help groups opf people communicate asynchronously in a graph
            - As it is, reactions are "siloed off" from the rest of the graph, which is absolutely too bad, because they are very content rich and potentially a source of valuable group attention convergence
            - basically, if someone adds a reaction, IMO, the author of that block should be notified somehow, or, non-intrusively, at least have a list of reactions that gets updated with "new/fresh/unseen" reactions, because I think that's a key way that conversations can start

    - Hey everyone! 👋🏼
        - With this huge surge of interest in solving the problems that us [[Roam]] users  are facing, I was having a chat with [[Bill Petro]] on [[Slack]] and the fact that we still don't have a fully functioning place to chat, engage, and archive our ideas is still pretty glaring.
        - As an idea towards solving this problem, I really think if there was a push into figuring this out for #[[Roam Games]] would be very much possible.
            - My time at the moment is completely slammed with #[[Roam Book Club]] 3, so obviously can't focus on this, but I figured I'd stir the pot a'bit~
