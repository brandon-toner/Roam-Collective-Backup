            - Block level tags reduce the search costs within a knowledge graph
                - {{[[DONE]]}} "#N The added context provided by [[block-level tags]] decreases the [[search costs]] and the amount of energy required to understand others' stream of conscious thought"
                - {{[[DONE]]}} "#[[N]] [[block-level tags]] are a great indicator of [[signal]] within a [[collaborative graph]]."
                - {{[[DONE]]}} "#[[N]] Strategic and intentional use of [[conventions]], improves the ratio of [[signal]] to [[noise]] by promoting [[clarity]] and [[order]]. [*](((io7qOh0kA)))"

                - {{[[DONE]]}} "#N When you reduce the amount of effort necessary to understand an idea, you increase the amount of people that can build on it.[*](((dBkUYuwoz)))[*]([[zettelkasten]])[*]([[collaboration]])"

                - {{[[DONE]]}} "#[[N]] Writing [["N"-notes]] in context, rather than in a designated location reduces the [[friction]] of capturing them, and helps to preserve [[context]]. #zettelkasten #Tips"
            - "#[[N]] the use of [[block-level tags]] captures the spirit of [[thinking out loud]] and [[working-in-public]]."
        - Structured Thinking
            - Block-level tags support more structured thought by forcing writers to separate atomic pieces of knowledge

            - Denoting the type of atomic thought (using block-level tags) forces authors to  apply type-specific conventions and thought processes
                - E.g., framing a question clearly; summarizing the core idea within a single fleeting note (and nesting elaboration within); separating evidence from claims
            - Block-level tags enable an "annotation" style writing, supporting tangential thinking on the fly while operating within a distinct context scope (piece of reading or writing)
                - "#[[N]] Annotating writing and literature with [[block-level tags]], fosters a consideration of the structure of [[narratives]]."
            - Working with block-level tags allows for the creation of well-structured, clear, and concise statement chains / proposition chains 
                - "#[[N]] the use of [[block-level tags]] for annotating [[statement chains]] improves the quality of ones [[thinking]] and [[writing]]."

        - Rediscovery
            - #Q How do considerations around rediscovery/resurfacing differ from considerations of search costs?
            - "#N The use of [[block-level tags]] in combination with [[key words]] facilitates a stronger conversation that transcends the "now" -- extends across time."
            - "#N A users planned method of [[information retrieval]] will impact all of the [[knowledge]] [[structure]]s they prefer using"
            - "#[[N]] [[ideas]] and [[action items]] arise naturally in [[conversation]]."
                - "[[Roam]], in combination with the [[conventions]] set out by RC simple allow these natural conversation elements to be captured — and resurfaced in related instances in the future. "
            - "#[[N]] The selection of which [[block-level tags]] are implemented as graph [[conventions]] should be determined by how users may want to filter/query data."
            - "#[[N]] [[memory]] is very [[context]]-dependant."
                - Block-level tags allow you to resurface a thought within it's original context
            - "#[[N]] When ideas are documented in [[zettelkasten]] [[conventions]], they persist through time. This improves [[resurfacing]]."

            - "#N [Block-level tags]([[block-level tags]]) should be used to summarize atomic and focused thoughts and pieces of knowledge"
            - "#N Educating new users of [[knowledge graphs]] on the power of [[discoverability]] and the available [[search]] functions is critical to [[onboarding]]"
            - "#N [Block-level tags]([[block-level tags]]) should prioritize short words with no spaces so users are not required to rely on the [[auto-populate]]d menu"
            - "#[[N]] CSS for [[block-level tags]] should allow for easy [[parsing]] of the constituent parts; adding visuals cues allows for easier and more rapid processing of block contents."
            - "#[[N]] Writing [["N"-notes]] in context, rather than in a designated location reduces the [[friction]] of capturing them, and helps to preserve [[context]]. #zettelkasten #Tips"

            - "#[[N]] the use of [block-level]([[block-level tags]]) [[questions]] invites and inspires others to jump into the conversation — multiplying the probability of arriving at some worthwhile [[conclusions]] and [[solutions]].[*]([[collaboration]])"
