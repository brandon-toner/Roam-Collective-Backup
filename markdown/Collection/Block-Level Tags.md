            - Denoting the type of atomic thought (using block-level tags) forces authors to  apply type-specific conventions and thought processes
                - E.g., framing a question clearly; summarizing the core idea within a single fleeting note (and nesting elaboration within); separating evidence from claims
            - Block-level tags enable an "annotation" style writing, supporting tangential thinking on the fly while operating within a distinct context scope (piece of reading or writing)

        - Rediscovery
            - #Q How do considerations around rediscovery/resurfacing differ from considerations of search costs?

            - "#FN Educating new users of [[knowledge graphs]] on the power of [[discoverability]] and the available [[search]] functions is critical to [[onboarding]]"
            - "#FN [Block-level tags]([[block-level tags]]) should prioritize short words with no spaces so users are not required to rely on the [[auto-populate]]d menu"
