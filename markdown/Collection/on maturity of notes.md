- What is the relationship between complexity and maturity?
    - Think of complexity and maturity as two axes that combine to describe the type and state of any knowledge artefact.
        - See: "#Diagram On Maturity & Complexity"
        - **Maturity** describes the level of refinement of an atomic unit of thought — how developed is the idea?
        - **Complexity** describes the level of an atomic unit of thought — how complex is the idea?

- Why is maturity important?
    - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] "Establishing levels within [[evergreen notes]] lowers the bar to creation and raises the bar for [[maturity]]." - [[Charles Farr]][*]([[creativity]])[*]([[minimum requirements]])[*]([[zettelkasten]])"
    - "We are close to nailing the nuance of a [[[[E:]] low floor, high ceiling]] [[zettelkasten]]! #Bookmarks"
    - "The idea of having some levels within evergreen notes lowers the bar for creation but raises the bar for maturity"
        - "In doing so, it can serve as a [[forcing function]] to actually complete high quality permanent notes or zettels[*]([[evergreen notes]])"
- How can you implement it?
    - "For instance: `#Ideas` → `#InProgress` → `#Completed`"
        - "Or: `#Fleeting` → `#Permanent`"
        - "Or: `#Seedling` → `#Budding` → `#Evergreen`"
- What are the levels of complexity?
    - Different Scales
        - Zettelkasten
            - Fleeting
            - Literature
                - "**Literature Notes** are summaries of what I am reading or other general factoids — they are important to understand by alone don't speak to the novel points or ask the pertinent questions"
            - Permanent
                - "**Evergreen Notes** are atomic ideas, hopefully novel ones, that I composed based on a foundational of Fleeting and Literature Notes."

            - Speculative Outlines
- What are the levels of maturity?
    - There are few "accepted" levels of maturity within the knowledge management community.
    - Often communities adopt a [[mythology]] to describe some elements of maturity. Mythology is fluid and can be designed to fit a users of communities preferences.
        - #[[Literature Notes]] [Mythologies]([[mythology]]) are used as a [[mnemoic]] device to boost understanding and retention
- "[[The stages of [[maturation]] of [[zettelkasten]] notes]]"
    - "These three note types are distinct, but trend towards higher level complexity..."
    - "[[maturity]] comes from the state of a given notes"
        - "Fleeting Notes have no stages — they either exist or they don't (though it's important to add context if important)"
        - "Literature Notes have no stages either, but there is a more ardous process to create them — unlike Fleeting notes, they come out of a source material, so care needs to be taken to summarize accurately and concisely"
        - "Evergreen Notes do have maturity, determined by 1) the level of development of the main thought (i.e., the "title"), and 2) the level of context provided to support them"
            - "In my personal graph, I use Seedling, Budding, & Evergreen tags to indicate the level of maturity..."
                - "Seedlings — the big idea is present; I may or may not have collected some contextual references; I have yet to summarize the context"
                - "Buddings — I have begin to summarize the context and connect it to other notes in my graph; I am working to firm up the supporting references"
                    - "Often through this process, I find that the big idea is refined"
                - "Evergreens — I have the big idea tacked down and all of the context and supporting references"
                    - "Often I take some time between the Budding & Evergreen stage to step away; when I return, I can see the note with clear eyes and make adjustments as needed"
    - "To you're original [question](((vc2Px8TdX))), it's not always critical to get all the way to an Evergreen on the first pass. If I am able to pull together a seedling, I find I've generally captured 70-80% of the idea. The [[maturation]] process gets me the rest of the way to 100% (or at least close)."
        - "One big component I hope to layer in is [[spaced repetition]] writing to ensure that maturation process occurs across my notes and I don't lose any within my graph...  "
    - "[[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] Also wanted to get your attention here, especially in relation to your comment [here](((dpsc4UzxX))) on maturity as it relates to truthfulness or accuracy"
        - "Seedlings — the big idea is present; I may or may not have collected some contextual references; I have yet to summarize the context"

                - "get the idea down on "paper""
                - "mark it as an "immature" evergreen or some such"
                - "then have a process that forces you to return and mature it... "
- Inception
    - "get the idea down on "paper""
        - "mark it as an "immature" evergreen or some such"
    - "**Fleeting Notes** are those that are very unrefined or tangentially related to a topic I am reading about — they will get processed and eventually be incorporated into more mature original notes..."

    - "then have a process that forces you to return and mature it... "
        - "In doing so, it can serve as a [[forcing function]] to actually complete high quality permanent notes or zettels[*]([[evergreen notes]])"
- Community Acceptance
    - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[maturity]], should consider the **acceptance of a term and claim among the community**, in the context of [[collaboration]]."
        - "Example:: If some terms is used widely by a particular person but his thoughts is not wide spread in the community, then it implicates that the term he/she use is not good enough or he/she didn’t provide enough context for that term. It’s good for personal I usage, but not publicly."
        - "**Therefore**, those true but less acceptance terms are not necessarily turned into a page as soon as it comes up."
