        - [[propositions]] versus [[notions]]
            - Proposition
                - something offered for consideration or acceptance ‚Äî proposal
                - the point to be discussed or maintained in argument usually stated in sentence form near the outset
                - a theorem or problem to be demonstrated or performed
                - an expression in language or signs of something that can be believed, doubted, or denied or is either true or false
            - Notion
                - an individual's conception or impression of something known, experienced, or imagined
                - an inclusive general concept
                - a theory or belief held by a person or group
                - small useful items ‚Äî sundries
    - #Conversation
        - [@Samuel]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) [regarding bookmarks](((sdbslN-d9))), unfortunately there isn't any way you can do this. RoamHacker's block mentions only look at individual blocks, not tags associated with their parents.
            - Though we could probably build come custom [[datalog]] to tackle this...
        - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) agree regarding the [maturity of thought](((qB-cP3Wo7))) around block-level tags...
            - {{[[TODO]]}} #[[Follow Up]] Review [[block-level tags]] & aggregate into collection
        - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) and [@Samuel]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) on [[block-level tags]]
            - "#FN Making the characteristics/type of our sentences/blocks explicit tells others how and where to join the conversation."
                - #FN The added context provided by [[block-level tags]] decreases the [[search costs]] and the amount of energy required to understand others' stream of conscious thought
        - [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) [re](((hgrZ2dAS8))) Most will use some sort of `import()` statement to pull code from a distributed location (generally github), so I don't think the Agora would need to host and distribute code.
            - However, if we got Roam Inter up and running in The Agora, we could easily aggregate updates centrally
        - [@Brandon]([[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]) & [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) on Weekly Summaries
            - I think something like [this](((dFbvCf9ei))) could be incredibly useful. However, is there a way to do some of this programatically?
            - It could be cool to aggregate all new questions or fleeting note blocks added on a daily basis ‚Äî could do it in the header...
                - Just saw the "#[[The Zettelkasten]]" queries ‚Äî looks great...
        - [@Samuel]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) let's brainstorm a bit more on [this](((JZqN2rYS0))) ‚Äî I like we could structure the "database" in a few pages and then building some sort of mockup would be dope.
        - [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) [any and all help is greatly appreciated!](((aehiME_SV))) I saw you logged a bit of work their today, thanks! I'm going to get back to it myself tomorrow...

            - Second number can be a discussion on convergence and divergence?
            - as we draft these two we should have a `RC Newsletter/Pipeline` so that we can continuously feed multiple beasts at the same time and whenever a specific topic has enough material we can get a newsletter ready to be sent.
