            - Source:: Tweet by [[Visakan Veerasamy]]
            - The greatest challenge is coming up with coherent, minimally overlapping classifications. [*]([[Seedlings/mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE)]])
                - Source:: Reply to Visa's tweet.
            - #[[FN]] Start with known [[classification]] systems and adapt them to specific needs.
                - #I Use [[Wikipedia]] to find existing [[classification]] systems.
            - #Q What [[classification]] systems, [[taxonomies]], or lists would be useful within Roam Collective?
                - List of [prepositional linkages]([[prepositional linkages]])
            - #I I would like to begin collecting classification systems. Mostly in my personal system, but many will apply here. 
                - This would look like a `#Classifications` tag, which serves as a parent to the `#Collections` class of tags.
                    - A [[classification]] is a set of collections that map a domain or system.
        - #Q Could a [[spaced repetition]] extension be built with PER USER settings?
            - Algorithm and card management on a per-user basis...

                        - This would also emphasize the importance of logging information in these places so that it is surfaced for inclusion of the weekly highlights.
                - This would help to keep Twitter and members of the graph apprised on events, updates and highlights.
                - This would also help to drive engagement for members, giving them a reminder and an easy jump-in point if they wanted to contribute some ideas.
        - #Q Could the tag styling CSS be changed such that the background of tags could be changed all together? [@]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])
            - Desired style:
                - Most = dark grey
                - Some = special & unique
            - Goal: Be able to adjust the dark grey at will easily.
            - #Q What classes of tags are there that might have different colors?

            - Atomic ideas are easily digestible. This is the format of a proverb.

            - Thoughts::
                - This is not an idea, nor a fleeting note -- it is moreso benefits or additional commentary on the reasons the idea would be worthwhile. 
                    - Comments feels too broad and pointless
        2. [@Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) on [RG3](((7z8czexD_)))
            - I briefly explored this [here](((j44mqPh6J)))
                - I think this is the necessary next-step: taking the existing (major) Roam Games submissions and contributors and creating a network of those ideas.
                - We could map the dependencies similar to how we document [[relevant notes]] on ENs
                - Maybe there are some [prepositional linkages]([[prepositional linkages]]) that could be identified to connect the submissions

                        - The nature of the influence could be added next to the mention with simple text.
                    - Perhaps plural for "`Contributor::`"
                    - #Q How could the "ancestors" be explicity connected to roam games submission pages?

                - A place to collate ideas & influence related to Roam Games
            - Structure
                - DNP for live conversation
                    - Following current Roam Collective conventions
                - Submission pages connected to graphs via Roam Inter to aggregate updates seamlessly
                    - Every new push should be nested as follows

                    - People would be represented by pages (e.g., `[[Charles Farr]]`)
                        - Standard conversation conventions would allow for communication & tracking
                        - Additional convention required for attribution (outside of contributor)
