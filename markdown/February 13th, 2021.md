            - The greatest challenge is coming up with coherent, minimally overlapping classifications. [*]([[[[E:]] mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE)]])
                - Source:: Reply to Visa's tweet.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Start with known [[classification]] systems and adapt them to specific needs.
                - #I Use [[Wikipedia]] to find existing [[classification]] systems.
            - #Q What [[classification]] systems, [[taxonomies]], or lists would be useful within Roam Collective?
                - List of [prepositional linkages]([[[[E:]] prepositional linkages]])
            - #I I would like to begin collecting classification systems. Mostly in my personal system, but many will apply here. 
                - This would look like a `#Classifications` tag, which serves as a parent to the `#Collections` class of tags.
                    - A [[classification]] is a set of collections that map a domain or system.
