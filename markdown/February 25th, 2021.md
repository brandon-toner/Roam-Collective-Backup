    - #Inbox 
        - RC conversation vs the Colour based conversation like in RBCII(?)
            - Inclusivity vs traceability
            - What it's easier to stumble upon
            - What is cleaner?
            - What is more scalable
        - Alfred targeting the Inbox would be nice.
            - If you chose different graphs it would be useful, but could be interesting.

            - If you see this, sorry I am in the middle of a messy room fool of receipts and reorganising tasks for the next few months. Hopefully tomorrow I'll add something if you have't written it yet.

        1. [@Peter]([[~[[Peter Rosso]]]]) [On GTD](((9IjO0uID4)))
            - I'm got a bunch of half-baked ideas that I think could be refined through conversation. Would love to hammer it out sometime. 
            - I can see a really neat blend of the [[Date Planner]], and a GTD Dashboard page of sorts. 
                - With integration of the horizons of focus.

            - Working on further refining "Outline of relevant FNs"
            - A few questions as I think about the value of block-level tags...
                - Is it worthwhile for us (the RC) to rationalize the various block-level tags we use?
                - How does the mechanism of block-level search impact the value of block-level tags?
                    - How does the mechanism of "Apply Children" impact the value of block-level tags?
                - How do block-level tags impact the structure of the underlying graph?
            - [[Conor White-Sullivan]] had a great related tweet here today...
