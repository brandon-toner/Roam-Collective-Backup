            - [[project management]] #Processes [*]([[[[Roam Games]] Challenge 1: Project Management in a team, with handoffs]]) [*]([[projects]])
                - Steps
                    1. Anyone creates a project
                    2. They add it to the change log
                    3. They add their name as applicable
                        - {{[[embed]]: ((A57j9482B))}}
                    4. They discuss the project with teammates, community members and leaders and necessary to gain momentum on the project.
                    5. They assign attributes as applicable
                        - {{[[embed]]: ((YvnvKBKxB))}}
                    6. Ongoing commentary about the project can be nested under the project page within the [[DNP Section]]
                - [Handoffs]([[handoffs]])
                    - Simply change the [project lead](((oGmvO4ycN)))
                        - This is a [[query]]-able attribute. `{{[[query]]: {and: [[Your Name]] [[Project Lead]]}}}`
                            - It might be even better to place the project status in the Tags line so that your could query for `{{[[query]]: {and: [[Status/Active]] [[Project Lead]] [[Your Name]]}}}`
                                - Project status would actually be **necessary** since you wouldn't want to see completed projects
                    - Other helpful queries
                        - "Projects I'm involved with" `{{[[query]]: {and: [[Status/Active]] [[Your Name]]}}}`
                - Notes::
                    - This could also work well with [[sprints]]
                        - A project could be included on a sprint.
                    - What else needs to be included?
                        - Components of a project? Sub-projects?
                        - Deliverables?
                        - Milestones? 
                            - This feels more related to [[goals]]
                        - [Dashboard]([[dashboard]]).
                            - Monitored projects and tags.
                                - Would love a dashboard of tags and the number of linked references of each. With similar styling to the [[unread references]] for [[block references]]. #[[Roam Enhancement Requests]]
                                    - Click the number to see the references — hover to dismiss.
                                    - This would be great in either a list or a grid.

    - #[[Scratchpad]]
        - The concept “space” is hard to define in the context of Roam collaboration, as mentioned [here](((bIl7_WLyg))). But, the **correct public Roam collaboration space** should...
            - enable custom css setting, which maybe supported natively by Roam in the future. Currently, it’s just possible to use web-browser plugin.
                - The reason why this is important is that visual representation help lowering one’s processing work load on messy information input.
            - enable custom auto-completion list.
            - distinguish private feed and public feed.
                - Though there’s no ‘private’ in Roam database, but the idea of ‘private’ is just hiding the complexity from the public.
        - Some **concept** on Roam collaboration comes up these days...
            - #[[FN]] Roam {X} protocol
                - **For example**, Roam publish protocol, Roam communicate protocol
                - **Explanation**: From the computer network’s perspective, all computers should obey some protocols before they can communicate. So, we need to set up a set of minimal 
            - Roam reputation system
                - This is the actual measurable reward for those members who’re producing knowledge and controlling their output complexity so that other people could find and understand his/her contents easily.
                - Soft rewards are better than restriction(?maybe) on encouraging Roamans to control the complexity of their contents when publishing.
        - {{[[embed]]: ((yFC7BCyMf))}}
        - {{[[embed]]: ((XT6pRAbyX))}}
        - One handy starting point to build up [[communication]] [[model]] in [[Roam]] is to adapt features from different apps([[e.g.]] slack, twitter, whatsapp, telegram). #[[Experiments]]
        - But [[communication]] [[model]] is not the whole point, it just serves as a component for better [[collaboration]].
        - Using the [[model]] of distributed system([[i.e.]] each entity should have the ability to store, compute, communicate), beside [[communication]], we should also think of the [[computation]] process. Logic inference is the important part.
    - #[[Chat]]
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Is it valid to add tags to for ones usage(public oriented)?
            - For example, I may want to add a tag like `#experiment` for the sake of easy query.
        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] So interested in your [chat plugin](((jMzfRp8cF))) mentioned yesterday. Can I join the discussion or even the implementation? Some ideas below ...
            - One of my biggest wish to the chat plugin is to be able to model the communication process with both inner-selves([[i.e.]] Antar, an Android app) and outside world.
                - **reason** why I wanna combine inner selves chat and outside world chat as one single model is that, ...
                    - we could model **‘I’ in different time as different person**, then, the question is then transformed into **async communication with outside world**.
                    - also, take the Android app, Antar, as an example, it mainly focus on **commutation between different modes of ones own**, [[e.g.]] angry me, calm me, etc.
                    - this model maybe [[Related]] to [[spaced repetition]].
            - According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [[model]] the [[communication]] **entity, as tags or block-ref-id** and the whole [[communication]] process as **publish-subscribe model**. More explanation below. cc: [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
                - **Property** of a [[communication]] entity is **reachability**, in other words, anything in [[Roam]] database that’s reachable, is a valid [[communication]] entity.
                - semantics on [[communication]] entity
                    - A Roaman ([[e.g.]] [[Matthew Vogel]])
                    - A group of Roamans([[e.g.]] Roaman in [[Roam Book Club]])
                    - A thread in [[Roam]] (more explanation below)
                        - the concept, **thread**, you could think of it as **a NPC in game**, it told you the information that has already been set up in the past ([[i.e.]] sentences leaved by others)
                            - In the extreme case(maybe someday), you may not even know who’s talking in the thread.
                    - An event([[i.e.]] activity) in [[Roam]]
                    - A global public feed in [[Roam]]
                - **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [[communication]] entity, in other words, each block in database is a [[communication]] entity.
            - Maybe one important property of inner self chat is that, we tend to achieve **consensus** across different selves, otherwise we will get mad with our own. While communication with outside world doesn’t always require this property to be hold. reply [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]] on [this](((XEO7RXlX2))). #[[.concept/difference]]
    - #[[Change Log]]
        - Add [[Experiments]] tag ((for the sake of tracking my own experiment ideas))

        - "And what I wanted to say at the [[Clubhouse]] meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [[Roam]] due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [[RoamLab]]. It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [[~]][[Kyle Stratis]]

    - #Scratchpad ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))
        - "With this huge surge of interest in solving the problems that us [[Roam]] users  are facing, I was having a chat with [[Bill Petro]] on [[Slack]] and the fact that we still don't have a fully functioning place to chat, engage, and archive our ideas is still pretty glaring." 
            - I have some big ideas in regards to this, I would like to share them but need to finalize a couple things. Stand by. Will let everybody know when I am at liberty to speak. [[@[[Beau Hann]]]]

        - "However, I will say that now it seems like there will be multiple "Akiff" pages for me to follow. Akiff Comments, Akiff Bookmarks, Akiff Saved, Akiff Mentions - could be all added into just the [[Akiff Premjee]] page which seems like an interesting idea. Kind of like a personal home page with everything that I need to act on. "
            - I could create/demonstrate some "[[dashboard]]" options if we desire? [[@[[Akiff Premjee]]]]  See image below ⬇️

        - "[[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] this also brings up an interesting use case of __following__ a thread or a comment. I wasn't involved in the original comment but would like to be included in follow-ups or just follow peripherally. If there was something like an "AP Follow" tag that would be cool. I'm not fully involved in the conversation maybe or maybe I am but these are threads or thoughts I'd want to follow as they more fully are developed in the graph (wherever they may develop). This is not really a hand-off but more of a "more hands on or more eyeballs on" haha"
            - The UI/UX for such things will get complicated quickly. So having a variety of global navigation blocks or similar might be useful here [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]. You could also see an example, though not really for this exactly, here [➡️](((lRBaD3yYL)))
        - "[[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] I moved your comment on Beau's block to a nested position to promote better readability, FYI."
            - Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention. Honestly not that big of a deal frankly. Just an observation [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]
        - "That's a great illustrative example. Love that. Any suggestions on how we might apply that technique to our conventions here? [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]]"
            - I would have to say that all I would say at this moment is to allow ourselves to find the path, document the justifications/reasons for sticking with and convention and allowing others to see the justification. Though I believe you are already doing this. So let's just do it. [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]
    - #Questions
        - What are everybody's workflow with responding to comments/attention in this graph. I made a quick little loom showing one way. Curious. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]

            - Separately, but related. How can we `@everyone` if we have the gall to do so? [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]

    - #Scratchpad 
        - So weird, I can't create a new line at the first bullet level on the daily note page but I can nest bullets and create sub bullets 
        - Even if I `shift + tab` I can only do so until I get to the second level bullet. Can't go back to the top level bullet 
        - On Bookmarks convention:
            - "This is a great convention and interesting way to follow things I'm interested in. Queries for my name + bookmarks should be able to get me there. "
            - However, I will say that now it seems like there will be multiple "Akiff" pages for me to follow. Akiff Comments, Akiff Bookmarks, Akiff Saved, Akiff Mentions - could be all added into just the [[Akiff Premjee]] page which seems like an interesting idea. Kind of like a personal home page with everything that I need to act on. 
            - Would even be interesting as projects go live to show everything that I have to do for a project there and that would be my home base. 
            - I like the idea of DNP for __interaction and collaboration__ and then my own personal page for updates that concern me or things I've chosen to follow. A self curated feed. 
    - #Promptstorming
        - How should we handle graph instability?
            - Two solutions:
                - hope and pray lol
                - auto-backups - I think once we can figure out a stable way to do this (which seems to be in the works or live?) we can just deal with instability as Roam builds things out

        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] your Bookmarks convention got me thinking about multiple pages per person that they would have to follow and creating a kind of home base on your own personal page
            - "On Bookmarks convention:"
                - ""This is a great convention and interesting way to follow things I'm interested in. Queries for my name + bookmarks should be able to get me there. ""
                - "However, I will say that now it seems like there will be multiple "Akiff" pages for me to follow.

Resolve by "[[replace as text]]""
            - Oh interesting our CSS looks different for block references. I wonder if css is person specific? But I also didn't change anything in roam/css

        - "A cool approach to this is to filter YOUR PAGE [[linked references]] by Bookmarks, or any other of the [[DNP Modules]] #Tips"
            - Yeah but only issue with filters is that you'd have to continuously keep doing it to look through all the DNP modules. Whereas a query could persist and act as a personal dashboard of sorts and hidden under a toggle as needed

        - "[[~[[leekeifon]]]] [That sounds very interesting](((-vJfNui_K)))... Can you expand on what you see as the differences between inner chat and outside chat and the overall use of such a distinction?"
            - Fascinated by the idea of Personas!
    - #[[Scratchpad]] 
        - Connected briefly with [[Brandon Toner]] & [[Akiff Premjee]] today on Clubhouse, discussed...
            - Orienting output in the graph around [[sprints]]
                - See: "Group #Sprints as a [convention]([[Conventions]])"
                - I see the purpose of a sprint being orienting the group around a focus for a snapshot in time.
                    - The amount of thought emerging here is incredibly valuable, but it hard to accomplish tactical goals (such as building a [[graph seed]] for project management) without concerted effort
                    - The sprint could have a series of associated tasks and members can pick them up appropriate
            - Building an [[Urbit]] community for Roam Collective, with the potential to build an integration...
                - Urbit would allow for a persistent chat, with additional writing features
                - The nature of the Urbit platform could allow for some really interesting novel integrations...
                    - Writing the entirety of the day's chat (in urbit) into the Graph
                    - Displaying and linking to block references from the Urbit chat
                - The above are just two we discussed today, but there's a whole universe of integrations that could be built
            - Focusing our first sprint around the current [[Roam Games]] question: Project Management with Handoffs
                - Regardless if we submit anything, orienting the group around brainstorming on this question could be invaluable...
        - Looking at all of the [[SmartBlocks]] in the graph and I think we need to have an approach for delineating between personal SmartBlocks (and templates) and community ones #Conventions
            - Types of functions
                - Community functions can be useful to ensure correct usage of conventions and to distribute information
                - Personal functions are great for testing out functions and for niche use cases
            - Proposed convention
                - Personal SmartBlocks / Templates
                    - <FirstInitial+LastName> + <Function Name> + <Experimental (optional)>
                        - `CFarr + Custom Query (Experimental)`
                - Community SmartBlock
                    - <.rc+Index+Function Abbreviation> — <Function Name> + <Experimental (optional)> + <(RC)>
                        - `.rc1DNP — My Daily Notes`
            - Benefits
                - Easily distinguish between personal and community SmartBlocks / templates
                - Easily trigger the function in question...
                    - Searching by your name ([[e.g.]], `jjCharlesF`) easily pulls up a list of your functions
                    - Searching by "rc" pulls up a list of community functions, and you can easily specify using the abbreviations
                    - Note: These formats are helpful because you can't use spaces while searching using the `jj` trigger...
        - [[Projects/Submit Grant Application to [[Urbit]] for RC]]
            - Current Draft
                - Title
                    - Expand Community Space for Mulitplayer Roam Research
                - Brief
                    - Roam Collective is experimenting with how to build effective multiplayer graphs in Roam Research to enable vibrant knowledge communities
                - Details
                    - **Note:** Make sure people know what you’re building, why you’re qualified, and where the money’s going
                    - ...
            - I invited [[Brandon Toner]] to be a member of the proposal. If anyone else is interested in being added, feel free to Slack me your email...
    - #Questions
        - #Q Where should output live within the graph?
            - Output defined as a polished (or semi-polish product)
            - My thinking is that while work on a project can be done within the daily notes, there is a bigger role for pages
            - Is there are best approach to take here, or should it be handled on a case-by-case basis?
    - #Chat
        - [[@[[Kyle Stratis]]]] related to your comment [here](((bIl7_WLyg))), [[Brandon Toner]] and I were discussing the possibility of setting up an urbit environment for Roam Collective → see "Building an [[Urbit]] community for Roam Collective, with the potential to build an integration..."
            - I tweeted about [[Urbit]] & Roam the other day and they invited us to apply for a grant for hosting — plan is to hopefully get that done this week.
            - I know that you're familiar with Urbit, so would love to get your thoughts here!
        - Hey [[~[[leekeifon]]]] 👋🏼! Nice to meet you via the graph. I saw your note [here](((FehE8jv6_))) and wanted to point you to [[roam/css]] — I wasn't sure if you were aware, but you can set roam's css easily from the graph itself
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] what do you think about: "Looking at all of the [[SmartBlocks]] in the graph and I think we need to have an approach for delineating between personal SmartBlocks (and templates) and community ones #Conventions"
