    - #[[Change Log]] 
        1. Reorganized and decluttered CSS a bit — I've gone as far as my expertise will allow haha. [*](((xVo60DN5o)))
        2. Started to reorganize the shortcuts based on [this](((ZH-J4OPDR)))
            - Rationale:: "My thinking on why this order"
    - #Bookmarks

            - read: me, next few days haha
            - #I We could create a collection of "user statuses" as options for users to display on their DNP
                - Maybe it could even be a dropdown! 
                    - Or if you're feeling creative you can go off the list to add something unique.
                - Inspired by [Larissa's status updates](((JnHKrrTPC)))
    - #[[The Zettelkasten]] 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[curation]] is an essential activity within a collaborative graph community. 
            - Building on "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [Curation]([[curation]]) is a form of [[synthesis]], combining the viewpoints of others to elucidate insight"
            - To assemble a puzzle you need to make sure you've gathered the related pieces. #Metaphors
                - 1) Create ideas (pieces) -- divergence / brainstorming
                - 2) Gather related ideas -- collection / curation
                - 3) Look for patterns, reorganize, and summarize key themes -- convergence
                - 4) Use that new formed stability to continue the cycle.
                    - Build on the ideas, follow the tangents, continue the thread.
                    - Like adding a new level of scaffolding as you work your way up the side of a building. Building it as you go, and standing on the prior construction.
    - #Conversation
        1. Simple Replies
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] whenever I get a [sync issue](((86am-w_M5))), I copy my daily notes section to my personal graph, refresh, and then just copy back in — should capture everything (that on the DNP at least)"
                - Riiiight, this tactic slipped my mind. Thanks!
            - "Is there a way to highlight in a different colour the `Welcome 😃`, `Quick Start Guide` and 'Conventions`? This might attract the eye of new members."
                - Not that I'm aware, great use of Chat though! This escalated for reconsideration nicely. [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] 
            - "#Q Should we have a page that collects decisions/latest thinking on best practices for norms, that expands on "where to write"? or perhaps extends the FAQ?"
                - Absolutely. If you have a vision for how it could look, feel free to build it as you imagine! [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
            - "So many thoughts, so little time. Will return when I can."
                - No rush! Great to see you check in even as a one-liner haha. [[@[[Mark Robertson]]]]
        2. Outgoing messages:
            - [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] thoughts on [this](((P9-3EG6BG)))?
        3. Charles on [[fleeting notes]] vs [[seedlings]] #maturity
            - "#Q What differentiates [[fleeting notes]] and [[seedlings]]?"
                - Seedlings are more "on the path towards" evergreen. 
                - Fleeting notes are more chaotic, a bit less polished and concise.
                - The objective difference I would propose would be page-status. [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]
                    - Fleeting note becomes a seedling when it becomes a page.
                        - Intermediary step before acquiring the `[[E:]]` namespace and `#[[Evergreen Notes]]` tag.
                            - Same template as EN, but with `#Seedlings` instead of `#[[Evergreen Notes]]`
        4. #[[Follow Up]] "Re: [How To pages](((mMz7pLfVD))) [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[^[[Peter Rosso]]]] — I like the distinction, we can block reference out internal documentation where relevant in the How To pages — internal essentially being a subset  "
            - Don't quite understand this yet. Circle back.
        5. Keifon on Roam Games as a short-term goal
            - "Why not consider current [[Roam Games]] as a little short term goal for practicing our system towards a more robust system? It would be interesting! [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
                - Yea, great idea -- though I have limited bandwidth until mid next week...
                - I'll keep an eye on conversation if you want to keep riffing on it! By in large, I'm playing a long-term game with this project, but love the idea of [[sprints]]. Hopefully, I'll be able to carve out some time to keep up with it. But the beauty of the graph is based on the conventions, information should accumulate in a way that transcends time-alignment. 
        6. Keifon on verbatim notes
            - "#[[I]] For [[verbatim notes]], I think we could add a feature on it, that’s to help check the similarities of its content in the database and showing us who else is referring/quoting similar stuff. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]"
                - Yea, based on the block refs to original source, should usually be able to trace back informally. Not sure how to do that systematically though... besides keeping and eye on block refs?
        7. Keifon on async communication 
            - "#[[Q]] What’s the best practice for async communication? [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
                - Will need to reflect on this some more, no short-term solution immediately comes to mind... [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
        8. Dhrumil on potential Roam features / designs
            - [[Custom [[Roam]] /-Menu Which Grows with the User's Skill Level]] [[@[[Dhrumil Shah]]]]
                - Love [this](((g9GWQVxNJ))) idea
                    - Agree that more advanced users hardly use the slash menu, but I bet they would if it were suited to their growing need (extensions, shortcuts, etc)[*](((WxUPWq2y7)))
            - Seems like the sparkle would run it's course quite quickly! [*](((PVKEH1V7X)))
                - Doesn't take long to at least *see* features. But it takes a while to totally grok them.
            - Lots of great stuff in those notes -- I've bookmarked to return at some point.
        9. Larissa on a new shortcuts menu
            - "A proposal, to put something for people to react to:"
                - Love it! Gonna do this right away. How do I get those dash dividers?? [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
        10. Larissa's Questions:
            - "Questions I have:  "
                - All great questions! Every one of these disambiguations are on my mind...
                    - "They seem minor and I don't want to clutter the tag when there are more meaty questions at higher level of abstraction"
                        - I think yes. The meatier ones get escalated to page-level. (hasn't happened yet to my knowledge)
                    - "#Q When to use personal DNP vs. Roam Collective one"
                        - Personal = most
                        - Send a copy to the top RC one to make it more central. My vision is that the top section serves as a first place to look in the graph for the day. And memorializes highlights over time a bit better. I particularly like The Main Feed.
                            - Anyone can put stuff here.
                            - Kinda like [this](((j0l9zU-q-)))
                                - Feels easy to "get a sense of the day's work" [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]], [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
                    - "#Q When to use feedback vs. pose a question"
                        - Feedback is more for general themes and feelings about what is going well and what could be improved. 
                            - There is some overlap that needs to be ironed out....
                            - Examples
                                - "Love this (X) convention"
                                - "Suprised how well X is working"
                                - "Feeling confused about when to X... where to put Y"
                                - Actual example [here](#[[[[Feedback]]: What's working]])
                            - Maybe Feedback is more reflective in tone? But maybe that should be something named differently. [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
                                - Some overlap with how I've been experimenting with Observations.
                            - Maybe "Reflections" is best?
                    - "#Q When to use 📨 vs. 🚨 ?"
                        - I've been treating @ as closer to "response requested" and cc as "you don't really need to respond, but may want to see this".
                            - A bit fuzzy still for me.
        11. On Peter's CSS Bootcamp:
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I have been doing a CSS bootcamp over the the last few days, so I hope you don't mind I cc'd myself here: "^^Interested in best ways to organize this part.^^ **Open to edits/suggestions.** [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]]""
                - Heck ya! This is a great place to put that bootcamp to work
        12. On maturity for different notes
            - "Does each note type need multiple level of maturity?"
                - Thoughts:: [[^[[Charles Farr]]]]
                    - Fleeting -- nah
                    - Literature -- also nah
                        - Unless maybe a group of literature notes matured into a summary of the content... (but that feels more analogous to [[creative projects]] (loss of atomicity))
                    - Evergreen -- yes
                    - Evergreen Q's (whatever they are called) -- yes
            - "Does using a mythology popular elsewhere (seedling → budding → evergreen) muddy the waters?"
                - I don't think so! I like that metaphor quite a bit, and it's still in keeping with how others are using it... mostly. 
                - I'd say it works.
                - My challenge with "budding" is that it's hard to put objective boundaries on... when is something not growing? No longer a work in progress? [[^[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
        13. On [[filtering]] over querying
            - "[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] what benefit do you see for filtering a page using [[OR]] instead of constructing a regular #query ? 
`{{[[query]]: {or: [[ex-B]] [[ex-C]]}}}`"
                - Filtering is easier to do "on-the-fly". I like queries for standing searches, but I like to mess around in the filtering sections to "play" with the data a bit. [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
                    - I find it harder to "play" with queries. 
        14. On namespaces
            - "I uses namespaces extensively in my personal graph since I know they'll be useful in the future but at this moment in Roam they're cosmetic. You can't query for them without #datalog . Right now it feels like page references in the page name work alright but I often end up duplicating the page reference under a [[Tags]] attribute so who knows lol "
                - I do the same. 
    - #Feedback
        - #[[[[Feedback]]: What's working]]
            - Love the use of GIFs, Images, sketches, etc!
                - [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]] [here](((pA1lK9w6c))) and [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] [here](((PSVDrzk2_)))
            - Love these questions to gather clarity and input, then assembly into [[norms]]. [here](((mkTuyp16G))) to [here](((CaGPiJ2TS)))
            - Love these status updates! [[cc:[[Larissa de Lima]]]]

        - What is the parallel between the RC and the MIT provisional building mentioned in Deep work? 
        - ">  ...it’s worth pointing out that the Hindu-Arabic numerals aren’t just an extraordinary piece of design. They’re also an extraordinary mathematical insight. They involve many non-obvious ideas, if all you know is Roman numerals. Perhaps most remarkably, the meaning of a numeral actually __changes__, depending on its position within a number. Also remarkable, consider that when we add the numbers 72 and 83 we at some point will likely use 2+3=5; similarly, when we add 27 and 38 we will also use 2+3=5, despite the fact that the meaning of 2 and 3 in the second sum is completely different than in the first sum. In modern user interface terms, the numerals have the same affordances, despite their meaning being very different in the two cases."

                - One of the big goals of the games is to get designers jamming the same way the coders are
                - Roam42 does two things

First 
@roamhacker
 curated their favorite videos into a floating component you can access with a keyboard shortcut -- so you don't have to leave Roam to learn how to use Roam.
                    - i like the idea of having like a fast search of features and xparser compoenents and whatnot. maybe even the roam depot eventually.
                        - you can expand it to get an iframe of an external roam page which is just like a playground where shit doesnt get saved (or maybe this is in your own roam?) and you can just play around with the thing
                        - hopefully even use the search path component to then pull it into your current graph
                        -  curated their favorite videos into a floating component you can access with a keyboard shortcut -- so you don't have to leave Roam to learn how to use Roam. [*](((8Lg8CmObv)))

                        - ^^what if in docs, each feature comes with the slider thing so you can view how diffferent people describe taht same feature or use it in different ways? when you add it your thing to the slider, other people in your graph can see it? so the graph lead explains how to use each feature to the rest of the members?^^ hence its not FULLY playground like i previously predicted
                            - same thing applies in search? what if when you do collaborative search in a team, people can playground up the thing they're reading and save it as that so the other people in the team see that? nah, just use forked pages

                                - if this page is in help db for example, then your changes (even added versions) won't actually save to it
                                - if this is a page in your graph, then like how will roam write to it and update it over time without accessing your graph? ^^@hoshuaang's feed thing would work IF you could add versions from your graph that were only visible in your graph or something. so it's one-way stream where you can read the incoming stuff and you can play around with as a playground but it wont save state. to save your playground, create a version for that block and the versions are only visible in your graph.^^

            - {{[[DONE]]}} checking out all public twitter stuff for roam games hastag since yesterday
                - @zsviczian's stuff - for last challenge
                - @anirudhbadri stuff - long thread so that's nice. to be honest, not really on the same page with the wizard stuff, but maybe there's a version of this that contributes to what [[Feels Right]]
                    - Idea: Have an 'Onboarding Wizard' that asks users some basic questions, uses the responses to set up plugins and recommend tutorials APPROPRIATELY
                    - I'll get to how, but first why this approach? 
We have a[DesignProblem: There are so many awesome tools, plugins and tutorials. We want to avoid overwhelming new users with them
Also, we don't want to generate content, we want to maximally leverage RoamCult  content
                    - Each user has their own use case for Roam, and the toolkit that would give them 80% of their use case also varies. For example, a journaler needs advanced date manipulation, a designer NEEDS customisable CSS and fancy themes etc. The onboarding goal is to map users to resources!
                    - Put differently, the goal of the wizard is to find the minimum feature-set to give EACH user such that they see the magic and are all-set for at least 80% of their use case?
                    - So what questions do we need to ask?
1) Familiarity with networked thought tools (using other note taking tools doesnt help much UNLESS they want to use Roam to take notes)
2) Coding background
3)What their use case for [@RoamResearch](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch)
The Wizard would ask relevant follow ups
                    - Note that Wizard here is an abstraction above the particular implementation. The UI can be a chatbot, a questionnaire or even 'AI' that deduces use case from letting the user play in a sandbox
                        - seems somewhat related to the [[GPT-3]] stuff [[Taylor Rogalski]] talked about before
                    - So what would it do? Well, initially we'd have some static subsets of users. [https://twitter.com/tracyplaces/status/1356670295168454656?s=19…](https://twitter.com/tracyplaces/status/1356670295168454656?s=19)
The learnings from the approach here can be distilled into 'feature sets', the plugins that most of the users in the subset NEED, and 'tutorial sets' which the Wizard would serve
                    - The intention is to divorce content creation AND curation from the onboarding 'process', so that this can remain untouched even during massive overhauls of implementation. Also incentivises the best content makers for each niche to focus on helping their audience
                    - [@roamhacker](https://twitter.com/roamhacker)'s Help bar is an excellent model to think of how the Wizard can help on an ongoing basis. Imagine just filtering the community content based on what others working on the same use case have reported as useful. 

Also, switching to a different use case is just a Toggle
                    - And if the new user wants a personal onboarding experience, like so: https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1356601657807704065?s=19

The wizard can point them to 'use case' related experts who would offer (paid) half an hour sessions to get the user set up.  We want to build a Knowledge Economy as well, don't we?
                - [@tracyplaces](https://twitter.com/tracyplaces) - not feeling the use cases part. But hmm, tangential thought --- what if you can like connect your twitter or something to your roam. then people can search for twitter people they like that have roam, and send request to check out there roam? idk, but some shit along the lines of... how tf does team roam actually use roam would be interesting. idk if this can be pulled off in any way thats not like hella annoying for the graph owners tho. OnlyGraphs lol. [[Robert Haisfield]] hosts these roam tour videos which are great, i've emulated a lot of my process using Beau Haan and [[Joel Chan]]. What if Roam Depot was less like home depot and more like some medieval-aesthetic public market with a lot of color and movement? People could go on there and yell for what they want (like which usecase) and others could comment underneath how to go about it by linking to existing people implementing that.
                    - > Fundamental question for beginners: Where do you want Roam to take you?

Select from a roadmap of use cases, users, and uber-niche groups who can serve as guides to existing content. 

Conversations then help us develop new onboarding content based on common questions.
                - [@z9sx7wox](https://twitter.com/z9sx7wox) - there's a ton of focus on onboarding centering around use cases, even in those threads above^. To be honest, I'm not on the same page here, it feels like a cop-out.
                    - So a simple way of handling this is having us figure out what these use cases are that invite someone to fold in [@RoamResearch](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch)  into their life.

What are they?
                    - From there you can do a bunch of things 1) a simple button at the top of the screen that is a (?) - a help icon. - that shows up if (someone's graph has) < (# pages ) OR (# blocks) - this shows you it's a "fresh" graph
                    - this button can be what triggers the onboarding - start it off with a high contrast color in the ecosystem
                    - the onboarding can be a choose your own adventure type of thing - the adventures you can choose from are use cases that the Roam team (and [#roamcult](https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult?src=hashtag_click)) have identified.

Below are some of these use cases + good tutorials 4 them (I invite you to post links that you've found useful)
                - [@houshuang](https://twitter.com/houshuang) cross-graph conversation engine and feeds. those are cool. fits with the pattern of not having to leave your roam to learn how to use roam - his change log example in particular.
                - I totally need to speak to [[Robert Haisfield]] soon... conversing with him was one of the best things i did during my fellowship cycle. he totally needs to get paid from these games considering how much he contributes to the commons.

                        - He gives a very great overview of the actual core problems in onboarding. stuff like continuous onboarding, user goals change as their skills do, how do you help them imagine goals they dont even know yet (this is especially true with roam), etc. These questions would honestly take a couple of months to make progress on. Outside of the scope of this project due to time limits. but i'll point in future research suggestions as this is legit.
                        - > being aware of the features generally means you’ll be aware of when you should learn it to accomplish a new goal.

Due to principles of Difficulty Matching, we know that if we ask a user to learn something too advanced early in, they will likely get frustrated and give up. This is a common problem with Notion and Roam users: they see people using the applications in advanced ways near the beginning of their experience and they think that they have to implement everything right from the start.

These users would have far better outcomes if they simply operated at or slightly above their skill level to accomplish their current goals, but were aware of what could help them accomplish their future goals so they know what they can learn when those goals arise.
                            - honestly, this greatly supports the sparkle you see as you go through public roams and unseen features.

                        - > progressively reveals information as the user develops so they are always becoming more effective users. Even through behavioral tracking, it can be challenging for the app to recognize exactly what the user wants to learn at any given point. This means that there has to be a solid framework for exploratory search, where the user can find what they are looking for on their own or with the help of other users.

                            - > - ^^The app can only be so intelligent in recognizing when a user could learn something new.^^
    - The app can react to certain behavioral signals coming from the user:
        - user behavior could signal that the user is trying to do something in an inefficient way
        - user behavior could signal that the user has progressed to a skill level that's necessary to learn a more advanced technique
    - ^^The app can react to declared preferences and clearly expressed **user goals.**^^
        - The user could do a search for information. This requires the user to at least have at least a fuzzy idea of what they are looking for.
        - The user can describe to the app in some way what their goals are. This can come from "Questions during the onboarding".

Currently experimenting with integrations into journal clubs and new student onboarding.

                            - [[>]] When everything is new and unfamiliar, users feel uncomfortable. It’s a natural response. To help users navigate the unknown, you must help them feel safe. Nintendo knows this, that’s why they have players start the game inside a cave.
Why a cave? Because it’s a familiar metaphor. Users know what to expect: if we are inside, we must go out. It’s also easy to navigate and has none of the distractions of the infinite outdoors. Moreover, the cave’s boundaries reassure users that enemies won’t sneak up on them. When combined, all these contribute to help players feel safe.
A way for you to provide a safe place for users is to onboard them with a demo or tutorial document. The trick is to make it feel disposable. This encourages users to experiment. After all, who cares if you break a demo document?
                                - yeah so make the help thing a playground where you can test stuff around and not mess up the actual graphs. use same principle in the modals that show up (which could just be the help screen actually) when you click sparkle

                - #[[Content Notes]]
                    - Once Roam Multiplayer exists, onboarding will be dramatically more enjoyable. ((30QXYkryL)) would essentially be a web that you can browse consisting of all the graphs you have access to. New users can simply browse around public graphs, just like they do in the existing web, and click on an interesting block to see its "code" or [[Indicator on [[Roam]] Blocks Using Never-Before-Seen X-Parser Components or Templates]] to see its documentation. This would make it obvious to the user how Roam can be used.
                        - {{[[embed]]: ((((mXQeq6xBQ))))}}
                        - [[Roam Web]] search relies heavily on a concept I called `Networked Aliases` if you're interested.
                            - {{embed: ((YnJXOU5_-))}}
                    - In ((30QXYkryL)), read only graphs are essentially playgrounds where the user can move things around and write stuff as they wish. Of course, none of it will actually be saved. To keep their modifications, the user must fork the read only graph or send the blocks to a graph they can edit.

                        - sparke feature works REALLY well here, and honestly when roam web comes around, onboarding will be dramatiaclly easier
                        - with roam web, you can treat stuff as a playground without worrying about it saving in readonly, and can click on blocks to see their source code so you can reproduce stuff you see
                        - {{[[embed]]: ((((UwDkm_kBy))))}}

                    - currently you can set a global filter on a graph and thus only see that stuff. but what about when you're browing roam web? jumping between graphs, and their pages, and re-making queries? maybe this can be a small thing.
                        - "what if you can equip yourself with themes? or filters? if you equip yourself with filters, you will only see blocks which are using or not using those tags (or their aliases) -- also maybe you can enable unlinked filters to count and maybe enable NLP too. major [[Web of Intention]] vibes. Right now - graph owners can set filters to control what people that come on their graph can access, why not have this same feature for the readers so they only access what they want and hide the rest of the noise?

                    - Search bar on top and navigation bar on sides just like currently. This supports shortcuts for now, but could end up supporting native x-parser components and templates as well. Roam Depot documentation for components and templates could also be accessible from here, albeit not emphasized as greatly. Clicking on [[Indicator on [[Roam]] Blocks Using Never-Before-Seen X-Parser Components or Templates]] would open this and jump to the appropriate documentation. Each x-parser component has a toggle allowing it to be shown or hidden from `/-menu`.
                    - Each item has a button called `Explore`  which is revealed on hover. Clicking it reveals a wrapped Roam documentation block which can be treated as a playground to try the feature out. [[Stian Håklev]]'s demonstrates [*](((jXB7xuRDM))) how this block can be pulled from the Roam Help Graph. The challenge is that you would have to be able to add versions from your graph that were saved. The Roam Help Database is only a playground environment so you can't actually write to it. **The ideal scenario seems to be such that you can subscribe to the documentation block for a feature from the Roam Help Database and also create versions for that block only visible from your graph. **The documentation block would include:
                        - video (or playlist)
                        - description
                        - barebones set-up of feature so they can change things around and see what happens without worrying about anything breaking since nothing saves.
                        - This block can be versioned by anyone in the graph. For example, the admin might choose to version the block and add their own documentation on how to use it for their purposes.

Why a cave? Because it’s a familiar metaphor. Users know what to expect: if we are inside, we must go out. It’s also easy to navigate and has none of the distractions of the infinite outdoors. Moreover, the cave’s boundaries reassure users that enemies won’t sneak up on them. When combined, all these contribute to help players feel safe.
A way for you to provide a safe place for users is to onboard them with a demo or tutorial document. The trick is to make it feel disposable. This encourages users to experiment. After all, who cares if you break a demo document?"

            - [[Robert Haisfield]]'s website https://robhaisfield.com has some GREAT questions on [[Onboarding]] and provides an overview of the challenges which make it a tricky problem for Roam. Unfortunately tackling these questions was outside of the scope of this evening as it would take a couple of months to get right. Maybe this servers as inspiration for an ambitious Roaman? Here's a preview of some great quotes on the subject from his website:
                - "> being aware of the features generally means you’ll be aware of when you should learn it to accomplish a new goal.

Due to principles of Difficulty Matching, we know that if we ask a user to learn something too advanced early in, they will likely get frustrated and give up. This is a common problem with Notion and Roam users: they see people using the applications in advanced ways near the beginning of their experience and they think that they have to implement everything right from the start.

These users would have far better outcomes if they simply operated at or slightly above their skill level to accomplish their current goals, but were aware of what could help them accomplish their future goals so they know what they can learn when those goals arise."
                - "> In order to successfully onboard a horizontal product, we need to increase their skill over time to keep up with their changing goals."
                - "> progressively reveals information as the user develops so they are always becoming more effective users. Even through behavioral tracking, it can be challenging for the app to recognize exactly what the user wants to learn at any given point. This means that there has to be a solid framework for exploratory search, where the user can find what they are looking for on their own or with the help of other users."
                - "> People are often going to fail when they attempt to achieve their goals. How do we [Intentionally design for failure states](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/Intentionally-design-for-failure-states) so people try again instead of giving up?

            - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] re: "^^Interested in best ways to organize this part.^^ **Open to edits/suggestions.** [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]]"
                - Completely agree that the graph [[Beau Hann]] pullled together for RBC3 looks incredibly clean — something to emulate.
                - My belief is that any design revisions essentially fall into two buckets:
                    - 1) Updates to increase internal clarity of purpose
                    - 2) Packaging to enable easily access by external participants
                - On "1) Updates to increase internal clarity of purpose", the following tasks seem like good starting places
                    - Select a color scheme that we want to go with and build in standardized color variables
                        - "#Q Can Roam Collective develop a color scheme that better supports our key mission?"
                    - Rationalize down the number of tags we have a current (design has been divergent, time to converge a bit)
                    - Develop a visual language that has implied meaning
                        - For instance...
                            - All section-level tags have a background (e.g., "#Conversation")
                            - All block-level tags are bolded and add a `:` at the end (e.g., formatting like `#[[Q]] like #Evergreen)
                            - Aligning color palettes with specific tag groupings (e.g., all DNP modules tags are shades of blue while notes are shades green (spitballing here))
                    - Create some "dashboard" pages that aggregate specific tags (e.g., a layout that makes it easy to see the latest Questions, or Questions that have been answered, etc.)
                - On "2) Packaging to enable easily access by external participants"
                    - This is where we can really lean into a similar approach to the RBC — minimalistic, use of more hierarchical design (e.g,, tables of contents, headers, footers, embeds)
        - On disentangling note types & note [[maturity]]
            - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] I've been thinking about this all day and I think that we should disentangle note type and maturity status
                - Below, the lowest level of maturity is any type of note at the block level, then move up from there through levels of maturity after transclusion to a page
                    - Questions:
                        - Does each note type need multiple level of maturity?
                            - If so, should the levels of maturity be the same across note type?
                        - What is the right scale for maturity?
                            - Does using a mythology popular elsewhere (seedling → budding → evergreen) muddy the waters?
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2Fs72eIo55jm.png?alt=media&token=b693d9e9-c70b-4a47-9d7c-4cf0c6915bc6)

                - So this came up because I was going to go through questions to escalate some to page-level.  
                    - My process was to go through the questions and then organize/indent them, as a way to then decide what should be grouped/escalated, as well as provide a comprehensive view to allow for scoping/convergence (see ""Time for some [CONVERGENCE]([[convergence]]) — **Questions**" 🛠 Categorizing questions: ")
                        - Anyways, that was the dream. 
                        - The problem became every time I try going through the Q linked references, it gets so so slow that there is a good 3-4 second delay for every letter I type.  Basically, becomes unworkable
                            - For the specific challenge, I have now talked myself into a possible solution - I can just break the questions down by querying by day - that will probably make it more manageable. 
                            - However, the broader question remains
            - "PPV?"
                - What is PPV?

            - Support for [[curation]] idea by CFarr
                - "[[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] the curation of ideas around a specific topic (with a proposed conclusion drawn from them) is what I envision us using [[community notes]] for..."
                    - I support this!! 
            - Support for Weekly Reviews idea by PRosso
                - "[[Everyone]] do we have weekly and monthly reviews which can be used as structured ways to force convergence? Structured reviews become like habits and take increasingly less time and become frictionless as the systems put in place make them easy to perform [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] ((Shall we have review cycles to force convergence of certain topics so that we don't diverge too much?))"
                    - Think it could be interesting to explore - what types of questions / template are you envisioning?
        - Reactions to ideas on making things easier for [[new users]]
            - "Is there a way to highlight in a different colour the `Welcome 😃`, `Quick Start Guide` and 'Conventions`? This might attract the eye of new members." + could also be relevant for this: "Table of Contents or Shortcuts to jump to frequently used parts."
                - On a related note, should we add in dividers to segment out the left-side bar to likewise call attention to those (similar to how RBC3 has it)

                    - My thinking on why this order
                        - First, get your bearings about the big picture
                        - Next, quick start and reference
                        - Next, what to do when you're not sure what to do next
                        - Finally, additional reference you might check occasionally 
            - Love it! Gonna do this right away. How do I get those dash dividers?? [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
                - My RBC3 graph is not loading at the moment to check what they do, but I have seen in other graphs it being done "brute force" rather than CSS, by having a page titled "-------------" 😂  It works though!
            - [[@[[Dhrumil Shah]]]] lots of really interesting stuff - would you love to learn more about what's in the background in your mind, bigger picture motivation, so I can better contextualize in my own mind how to understand
                - Actually, reading the notes in reverse (starting with design inspiration) helped me a ton in understanding.   
        - On defining [[norms]] and best practices -> with conclusions + draft output
            - #Q Should we have a page that collects decisions/latest thinking on best practices for norms, that expands on "where to write"? or perhaps extends the FAQ?
                - Absolutely. If you have a vision for how it could look, feel free to build it as you imagine! [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
                    - Awesome! Pulled something together here: "Draft version of [[norms]] (for my own personal ease of reference)"
                - It could include, for example, this norm:
                    -   "#I Charles' convention for the conversation section might actually be best practice for the scratchpad as well! [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]"
                - Questions I have:  
                    - #Q When to use personal DNP vs. Roam Collective one
                        - "Kinda like [this](((j0l9zU-q-)))"
                            - LOVE IT 🔥🔥🔥
                    - #Q When to use feedback vs. pose a question
                        - "Maybe "Reflections" is best?"  
                            - For me, the word "Reflections" doesn't clarify the distinction.  It seems like it's more a matter of norms - it seems like we are using questions to drive discussion about processes within Roam, and using the conversations to hash out the answers to those questions.
                            - So for something like  ""Suprised how well X is working"", would it be in conversations if something is actively being worked on, and in Feedback if not?
                    - #Q When to use 📨 vs. 🚨 ?
                        - "A bit fuzzy still for me."
                            - Seems eminently sensible to me!
                    - #Q Should minor questions of clarifications also be tagged?  
                        - They seem minor and I don't want to clutter the tag when there are more meaty questions at higher level of abstraction
        - (low priority) On further exploring building "operationability" among atomic units and building blocks
            -  "[[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] I am so curious now."
                - [[^[[Peter Rosso]]]] the below block is an attempt to explain what I had in mind, a bit out there, more like several steps further down the line from agreeing on what's a brick :) 
                    - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] Creating a symbolic language or user interface that allows ease in "performing operations" on atomic claims would be analogous to inventing hindu-arabic numberals"
            - "Big fan for this [symbolic language idea](((_LaBRZ9kj))), I’m in. [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] #[[Experiments]]"
                - [[~[[leekeifon]]]] awesome!  it's been quite a while since I've immersed in math so wasn't sure if I was using the right terms; saw that you are into math so was going to ask you for your reactions on whether it made sense :)
