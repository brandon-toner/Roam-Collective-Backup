            - Found a better alternative: [[propositions]]
                - I was flipping through a book this morning and the author would summarize their main assertions or "propositions" at the end of each chapter. Brilliant. 
                - The tone fits perfectly ‚Äî it is declarative, yet suggestive. Not overly confident in tone, simply proposing some facts, claims or assertions.
                - The term is unique in the current array of zettelkasten expressions ‚Äî as to conflict with RBCIII, etc.
                - Example:: From [[Books/Administrative Philosophy]] by [[Christopher Hodgkinson]]

        - I've stopped using #[[The Zettelkasten]] as a daily module ‚Äî instead, I capture zettelkasten ideas inline using the block-level tags within my scratchpad. 
            - #Obs Ideas arise **in context** so having to jump section to put them somewhere else felt unnatural and not optimal for future re-discovery of ideas and context.
            - Instead, I've built a series of queries that auto-collect contents from elsewhere in my DNP section. 
                - #I Something similar could be added to the [[community notes]] section at the top.
                    - This would auto-compile ALL of the block-level tags used throughout the day by all users ‚Äî and would be a great way to detect [[signal]] in the graph.

        1. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) On [reading choice](((BUM_0plKB))) ([[Christopher Hodgkinson]])
            - VERY hard to find.
            - This author came HIGHLY recommended to my by a mentor of mine ‚Äî who studied ethics and organizational leadership for his PhD and was a previous superintendent of a school board. I borrowed his copy of a different one of his books ‚Äî¬†and recently found a few copies online via a second hand resale site. Just arrived on delivery yesterday.
            - In particular, his book, [[Books/Educational Leadership]] was recommended. I'm primarily reading that one now.

            - "[@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [On book recommendations](((sHamuQUzn))) Thanks a lot, my GF is doing a PhD in AI and education so she might find this very interesting."
                - Yea ‚Äî¬†she'd love it. Great historical look on education, with a focus on philosophy and morality. It's a gem.
        2. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) on [[fleeting notes]] vs [[propositions]] [*](((70BbCHmbe)))[*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])
            - I agree ‚Äî "#[[FN]] To keep ideas flowing, you need to keep [[minimum requirements]] low. #momentum"
            - #I I think that "[[flow state]]" writing can take place in the form of TRUE "fleeting" notes ‚Äî ones WITHOUT a [block-level tag]([[block-level tags]]) associated.
                - THEN, as insights emerge in the form of questions, ideas, and propositions ‚Äî they can be captured using the block-level tags.
                    - In this way, the [[conventions]] both optimize for [[flow state]] writing, while being capable of [[capturing]] [convergent]([[convergent]]) insight as it precipitates.
        3. [@Peter]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]) On [[questions]] [*](((GofzUrNr3)))
            - Kinda both actually. Stating questions summarized and converges uncertainty into a manageable unit. 
            - They set the stage for future divergence, through further exploration, or for future convergence through distillation and summarization.

                - Proofreading and writing require a very different kind of attention
                    - If the critical and detached voice, necessary in proofreading, constantly comes up when writing, we won't write anything or will do it very slowly.
                        - Perfectionists in writing are proofreading while getting their thoughts out
                - Outlining requires a very different type of attention... Big picture thinking, stringing together ideas into a narrative.

                    - Maybe you think their claim is good but it raises a question they haven't thought of asking, or they ask a good question but you have another answer that the one they gave

        - Code inspired dependency management
            - "[*]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) I was listening to a Python podcast before corona, and one of the episodes was about a graph analysis of different software packages. Python is a package which is still verified from the creator,  this gives the language centralised controlled systems. Other languages which followed more anarchic systems had problems growing and being maintained over time. Without an entity or a group of people, it is harder to how code would change over time. But at the same time, it would be great if we could leverage a more modular approach to everything developed so that people writing new code don't need to reinvent the wheel. "
                - The podcast explored the idea of centralisation of control versus lack of centralisation. Despite the latter approach ruby is still a widely used language, but what the Agora would do is to achieve centralisation. 
                - Every time I need to write new code I look for documentation. Documentation is accompanied by a centralised library of all the code that is freely available.
                - Another thoughts that comes to mind when thinking about code management and testing is CD/CI
                    - The idea is that code gets tested before being deployed. This works in an ideal world in which people actually write tests for their own code, but people never do that. When code is pushed to the main branch of their git remote, the code is tested and integrated into the general workflow. 
                    - If the code works and does not throw errors it becomes part of the bigger code.
                    - [@Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) [@Brandon]([[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]) ((see the whole thread)) One test case I thought that would be interesting is not to use the agora only as a way to collate ideas in terms of code, but do the other job of a dependency graph which is to propagate changes. #[[Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)]]
                        - Enters Roam Inter
                            - Imagine that the css and js necessary to run this page was organised on the Roam Agora. If the is a change on the code on the agora which only the creator can edit that change updates in the RC graph using roam inter.

            - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]), [On Claims](((KS6457gQP))) I will need to find the exact section of the book, but we discussed this last week at a reading (unfortunately not recorded). Some claims can be fleeting notes, but the converse is not necessarily true. From the original definition, I think we have been using the scratch book as a list of fleeting notes and then sorting some of them into claims. Most of the current fleeting notes are claims but fleeting notes $$\neq$$ claims.
                - Additionally, [On adoption of standards](((ct3Iw8fLY))) I think the next wave of Zettelkasten users will mostly be influenced by Beau's design given that he is running the RBC III. [cc:Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]])
                - On top of this it is worth considering what I have been repeating to anyone I zoomed about Zettelkasten development. In order to yield the greatest output it is important to have a personalised system that meets our needs.
                    - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) [On propositions](((TO6VRGI7D))) This is very cool! But I still think that a proposition is a subset of a fleeting note. Fleeting notes should give the freedom to a person to write almost in a state of free-flow so that then all possible connection, claims, the proposition can be drawn in a more definitive statement. #FN Proposition and claim feel like convergence (or at least the beginning of it), while fleeting note feels more like divergence.
