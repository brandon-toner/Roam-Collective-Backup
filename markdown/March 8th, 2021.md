        - [[@[[Alysson M. Costa]]]] re [change log](((BLrKswZok)))
            - Yup that's right! Change log is just for big changes that might affect other people.
        - [[~[[Kaito Kikuchi]]]] [welcome!](((HJB-DxxGd)))
            - Glad to have you here! Jump right in and let me know if you have any questions. 
            - Would also love your thoughts/impressions within a #Feedback section (simply add it in your section and nest thoughts underneath.)
                - I'm interested in the good, the interesting, the confusing, the unclear, the exciting, the intimidating, etc etc. [[cc:[[Alysson M. Costa]]]]

            - Think of this as a public thinking space. 
            - A central focus is the development of effective collaboration conventions for groups or teams in Roam — but it is much broader than that. 
            - You could legit talk about your anything (your fav foods, projects you're working on, an article that just blew your mind) and this is a place where people can engage with you on those ideas in a meaningful way.
            - Conversational energy oscillates, in that sometimes were are LIVELY with activity, and sometimes it fades — but part of the aim is how to manage that ebb and flow and to figure out good async systems.
            - One thing has become VERY clear to mean. 
                - [[Multiplayer Roam is more fun than single-player Roam.]]
                    - There is some [[dopamine]] shit going on here for sure haha. 
                    - I use graphs like this more than [[Twitter]] now.
                    - The depth of conversation, interactivity and the continuous build of ideas is incredible.
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        - CSS Changes general approach = softened appearance: (with versions)
            - Notification Tags
            - Top Section
            - Block-Level Tags
            - DNP Modules
        - Changed [[Roam42]] to test version
            - New "OPENPAGE"/"SIDEBAR" Commands available.
            - Can now auto-open conversation module in the sidebar on running the DNP (from there, pin it for the day) - [here's mine.](((tz8gJ1NJv)))
        - I murdered the FN tag 😱
            - Too much baggage with other systems of note-taking.
            - Now it's just the "N-note" — at least for now. 
            - Same usage, different name.

        - These days I mostly code for my PhD and working on the Roam API
        - But I do come here every couple of days looking out for anything going on.

        - Finally had some time to check this! Looks really interesting. Lots to learn! I created a page Alysson by mistake and deleted it. I don't believe this a is case for change log.

        - I'm starting to explore the [[zettelkasten]]s and find them very informative, especially seeing how people structure them
            - For example, [structuring Literature Notes as Verbatim Notes to combat cognitive burden](((kvrzNKc5u))) was revelatory for me.
        - I have a harder time grasping __how people use__ Roam Collective. 
            - Pointers to what do people do every day, what is a typical flow, example conversations and pages could be very informative for beginners getting up to speed.

        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] [on how to use Roam Collective](((Z2HuShhsE)))
            - OK this was really helpful! Thank you!
            - I like how a lot of thought is going into building good conventions for collaborative thinking
            - Also starting to feel what you mean by [[Multiplayer Roam is more fun than single-player Roam.]] 😄
