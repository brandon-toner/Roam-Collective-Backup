    - #[[Scratchpad]] 
        - In the [reference notes template](((gix1P4auD))), The "literature notes" and "highlights" attributes feel to individual...
            - I'm thinking on removing those, and graph contributors can document their lit notes and highlights under an "annotations" tag in combination with the page title.[*]([[Processes]])
                - Example:: [Charles on Knowledge Synthesis](((ubkuzczkv)))
                    - In this example, the annotation are not on the page itself, but rather within Charles' DNP Section. 
                    - This format allows for multi-user contribution of their annotation, without the need for an "editor" or main page contributor. 
                - The `#Annotations` tag is a parent tag for Highlights, Comments, and Lit Notes... really all user commentary on the reference material.
        - Processes:: How to annotate an article or other piece of reference material[*]([[annotations]])[*]([[reference notes]])
            1. Create a reference note for the resource. (Include the `[[R:]]` namespace)
                - Example:: [[Articles/Joel Chan ‚Äî Knowledge Synthesis]]
            2. Populate the new page with the [reference note template](((gix1P4auD)))
            3. Add the type of reference (Articles, Books, Podcasts) as a tag.
            4. Create a bullet in you DNP Section with the name of the reference note page and `#Annotations` #Important
                - Example:: 
                    - "#Annotations of [[Articles/How to write good prompts]] [*]([[cc:[[leekeifon]]]])"
                    - "#Annotations [[Articles/Agile Product Management in Roam]] - Part 2 ‚Äî [zsolt](https://www.zsolt.blog/2021/02/agile-product-management-in-roam-part-2.html)"
            5. The method of HOW you document your annotations here is less important... some creative liberties are fine and encouraged.
                - It is helpful, however to make use of tags such as: `#[[Literature Notes]]`, `#Highlights`, and `#Notes` / `#Comments` (?) 
        - #[[Roam Enhancement Requests]]
            - Ability to see "blocks of mine that were reacted to or referenced by other users" ‚Äî this would aid with [[notifications]].
                - I want to know, without relying on serendipitous discovery, that someone referenced one of my blocks somewhere, or reacted with an emoji. 
                    - #[[FN]] [Emoji reactions]([[emoji reactions]]) are almost like [[likes]] in other social platforms. 
                    - #[[FN]] Blocks referenced by other users is analogous to [[retweets]] on [[Twitter]].
        - Thoughts:: [[voting]] mechanism [@]([[^[[Charles Farr]]]])
            - **Methods:**
                - Via block ref count
                - Via emoji reactions
                    - By using üëçor ‚ûïon the `Option Blocks`
                    - By using 1,2,3 emojis on a `Summary Block`
                        - Using a `Community/Vote` attribute
                            - Pros:: 
                                - Can click that attribute to see similar votes
                                - Can reference that block to further elaborate on the thoughts/nuance behind the vote
                            - Cons::
                                - Need to expand the parent to see it. 
                                    - Is this a con? If voting with 1,2,3 then there isn't enough context on the parent block to gain insight into the meaning or direction of the vote anyway... expansion is required regardless.
                        - Using the `top-level parent` block
        - #Q How do we tag suggested or draft processes and conventions?[*]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])
            - I'm hesitant to tag with #Processes or #Conventions as to not dilute those tags with noise... but want to make sure that the bits of partial work are properly carried forward... 
                - Example:: "Thoughts:: [[voting]] mechanism [@]([[^[[Charles Farr]]]])"
        - #Q How should pages for [[sprints]] be designed? 
        - Ah! I think I have an idea on the sprints and projects side of things that helps to resolve the [[orientation]] problem, as well as maintains the DNP sections as the main place of writing...[*]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]), [*]([[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]])[*](((8TBYt9NTT)))
            - #I Within the "Sprint" or "Project" page, there could be an update log... a shared space where we we list the date, our name, and the work that we did on developing the active pursuit.
                - Within that update, we could link to the work that we have done that lives within our DNP sections. 
                - This would preserve the page's role as a HUB for navigation, without actually housing all of the actual work.
                - This approach would make the Sprint page easy-to-navigate and simple in it's outline and deep with information via referenced content. 
            - ORRRRRR
            - #I series of queries could exist on the page template... which would automatically gather the `#Outlines`, `#Questions % #Q`, `Fleeting Notes, Lit Notes, Evergreens`, `#I`s, etc that are related to the sprint.
            - ORRRR [[Why not both?]]
                - [Draft Sprints template](((tG1HJs2dK)))
        - Thoughts::
            - "[[connecting the dots]]" is a very Roam visual metaphor/saying...
                - Making connections between entities in a map of information... 
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        - Removed Literature Notes and Highlights from the [references notes template](((gix1P4auD))), adjusting the workflow to allow for multi-user contribution.[*](((7Jju0z75P)))[*]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])
        - Added the convention of adding [[R:]] [namespace]([[namespaces]]) for [[reference notes]] and [[Q:]] namespace for [[questions]].
            - See more: [Choice on Questions namespace](((_Wr78aOE-))) & [making a reference note: process](((FYmbBPKjS)))
        - Developed a [Sprints Template](((tG1HJs2dK)))
        - Created a sprint for [Roam Games 3]([[Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)]]) (merged with Charles' version)
    - #Conversation 
        1. Simple Replies
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] it's a new feature I stumbled across in [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/) that exports highlights and notes to markdown [*](((L5rLIvAsb)))"

            - How did you generate this syntax with page number? [*]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])
        3. On `[[R:]]` namespacing.[*](((sqydLl-Vb)))
            - I like this a lot. It consolidates namespaces for Books/ Articles/ Podcasts/ etc.
                - Feeling like this is a good implementation for RC. Create a page with an `[[R:]]` namespace for any references or resources in the database.[*]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])

    - #[[Bug Reports]]
        - Some `[[@[[Charles Farr]]]]` mentions don't show up within my `[[Charles Farr]]` page ‚Äî only really seems to impact notes from [Brandon]([[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]])
            - Odd. Will just rely on the actual `@` page for now...
    - #Scratchpad ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))
        - On moving towards a more agnostic [[taxonomy]]/[[mythology]] of notes...
            - Based on my thinking [here](((NOWabDQws))) I updated my personal taxonomy of [in my graph](((vxaP_RzP-)))
            - Principles at play here...
                1. Language and terms are system agnostic
                    - Draws on tenets advanced by both [[Andy Matuschak]], [[Joel Chan]], and [[Sonke Ahrens]]
                        - Due to the simplicity of [[Joel Chan]]'s structure, which it draws most heavily upon, there are few implied definitions associated with they individual note types
                            - The only definitions are those the terms share with the english language, hopefully boosting legibility and understanding
                2. Language and terms are concise
                    - Simple terms tied directly to the root definition in english [*](((wA02wBb0C)))
                3. Language and terms are cohesive
                    - To me, they "feel" cohesive ‚Äî hard to define exactly why...
                        - Likely just because they are simple, english words, all one or two syllables in their shortened form
                4. Ability to incorporate a separate mythology/taxonomy for [[maturity]]
                    - `Seedling` ‚Üí `Budding` ‚Üí `Evergreen`
                    - Mitigates confusion between types of notes and level of development

            - Notes
                - User stories could be organized around `#Qs`
                - Need to aggregate questions in one location ‚Äî `[[Backlog]]`
                - How do we want to define Sprints versus Epics?
                - Could use `[[S:]]` + `[[E:]]` to differentiate
                    - Could find ones that are Prioritized or not
                    - Could also have seperate block and page level tags...
                - Uses the Choice AoT
                    - Thinking about the potential to use a Decision AoT for community decisions
                    - Or a Review AoT
                - **Note:** This could easily be replaced with a combination of block-level and page-level tags + a few standard queries (probably more the speed of the initial user)
            - Highlights
                - My goal is to create a step by step how-to guide and a full-featured template database, that a product development team can pick up to kick-start their process using Roam. I assume that Roam will be the only task and user story management tool used by this team, and I am developing a fully self-sustained solution built 100% around Roam's capabilities.
                - My graph is public; I encourage you to look around. Read my user stories, check out my product backlog, look at sprint plans, personas, templates, roam/css style sheets, naming conventions, etc. Start here by accessing the [Product Vision](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamAgile/page/cwZ9xV-cp) page.
                - Agile takes a different path. Instead of detailed specifications and designs, the focus is on storytelling. Understanding how the user will use the product and delivering small increments of working solutions that the end customer can immediately use.
                - Agile works based on the understanding that often when you ask someone what they want, they will list requirements, most of which they will never need.
                - Agile requires a completely different mindset. If you have a team trained and socialized in traditional projects, you need to invest the time in training the team to be agile. The best is to bring in an Agile coach who stays with the team until they get in the rhythm of things, at least the first 5 to 10 sprints.
                - While Scrum looks simple, free-flowing, and straightforward, there are some basic rules you need to stick to consistently. You should religiously stick to Agile Ceremonies, especially while the team is still young and adapting to Agile.
                - There are five Scrum ceremonies (sometimes also called events), these are backlog grooming, sprint planning, daily standup, sprint demo, and sprint retrospective.
                - The three artifacts are product backlog, sprint backlog, and a potentially releasable product increment.
                - A Scrum team typically comprises seven to nine people, one product owner, one scrum master, and the development team.
                - Sprints should be short, typically one to four weeks long. Each sprint aiming to deliver a working product increment.
                - In an agile project, the scrum master is the master of ceremony. She/he is responsible to organize meetings, remove roadblocks, and maintain the rhythm of work for the team.
                - The team tracks future development work on the backlog. The backlog is a list of user stories, each describing a feature of the product from the user‚Äôs perspective. The product owner ranks the backlog based on importance and value. The product owner is the story-teller. His/her role is to explain to the developers how and why end-users will use the product.
                - The team works in sprints. At the beginning of each sprint, they pick stories from the top of the backlog, stories that are ready based on the completeness of the user story. They place these stories on the sprint plan and track their delivery typically on a kanban board.
                - I named my sprints ‚Äúsprint/Day 1‚Äù, ‚Äúsprint/Day 2‚Äù, but later renamed them to just ‚Äúsprint/1‚Äù, ‚Äúsprint/2‚Äù when I realized I bit off more than I can chew next to daily work.
                - I continued by writing an initial version of a `[[[How To](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamAgile/page/kr20N1M4E)]]` guide and a list of design `[[[Dilemmas](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamAgile/page/roVMgSAWO)]]`. This helped me think through how I was going to use Roam for managing my agile product development process. Later I created the user story `[[[story/Document final how-to guide](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamAgile/page/k6DkFj72_)]]` to update the How To guide. Any time I make a comment regarding use of the template, be it in a user story or elsewhere in the graph, I tag it with this story. As a result, I have all the reminders of how-to design decisions as linked references at the bottom of this user story waiting for me when I get there with my work.
                - See [demo](https://youtu.be/t6l_84svRxM)
                - s you can see on the screenshot below, you can craft a Datalog query to identify stories in the graph, but missing from the backlog.

                    - **Note:** This could easily be replaced with a combination of block-level and page-level tags + a few standard queries (probably more the speed of the initial user)

            - Notes
                - Indiviudal teams could have their own graphs and feed updates into a central repository using Roam Inter
                    - #I Roam Collective could build a more "polished" graph and set up an inter-feed to drop relevant content on a daily basis
                - #I An AoT for group decisions and group review ‚Äî necessary for a distributed, asynchronous, community project...
                - #I Using speculative outlining and collection building as a means of sprint planning...
            - Highlights
                - It could even work for larger groups of up to a few teams... however, the lack of role-based access management may become an issue as the number of the teams grow.
                - Why should you consider Roam as your platform for Agile Product Management?
                - Stories play a key role in Agile Product Development. The Product Owner is the storyteller. His/her role is to introduce the product to the development team. Understanding the intricate details of the product will allow the team to construct a solution that far surpasses anything they could have specified, designed, and built following traditional waterfall methodologies.
                - Stories, however, are inherently messy. Important details surface at the most unexpected times. A Product Development tool centered on stories, with the ability to deal with tasks, is more suited to this process than task management tools with the added ability to manage stories. The shift in focus is subtle but important.
                - As I was writing user-stories, doing daily standup meetings, reviewing customer feedback, etc. every time something occurred to me, that I should include in the final how-to guide, I tagged it with this story.
                - User stories are the Pattern Language of the product. See my blog post about¬†[Pattern Language for Effective Thinking](https://cdn.prowritingaid.com/website/2.1.11953/webeditor/Pattern%20Language)¬†if you are interested in pattern languages.

                - I have included 8 different algorithms in the Roam Agile template. These are:
                    - Choice
                    - Attention direction tools
                        - Consider All Factors
                        - Alternative, Possibilities, Choices
                        - Other People's Views
                        - Consequence and Sequel
                        - Plus, Minus, and Interesting
                        - Agreement, Disagreement, and Irrelevance
                        - Examine Both Sides
                    - Trouble, owner, Success Criteria, Actors
                - Charts¬†by David Vargas. I have included this in Roam Agile. This extension adds diagramming support for `{{line}}` and `{{bar}}` charts. I use `{{line}}` for the burndown charts in the sprint template.

        - #Q How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?
            - https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1359129393453355014?s=20
        - #Q What does an [[agile development]] approach look like for Roam Collective?
            - Agile projects are structured around...
                - Stories ‚Äî bite size pieces of work
                - Sprints ‚Äî collections of stories (work), time-bound
                - Epics ‚Äî collections of sprints, oriented around a goal
            - Adapting the framework to our goals at Roam Collective, I propose the following structure...
                - Stories ‚Üí `#Q` blocks that develop into `[[Q:]]` pages (or other tasks)
                - Sprints ‚Üí a portion (or all of) an outline or collection of `Questions` to answer during a given time period
                - Epic ‚Üí an entire outline or collection of `Questions` to answer during an overarching `Question`
            - ---
                - #Meta conversation with myself...
                    - As I am thinking through the Epic & Sprint structure, what if Epics were speculative outlines and sprints were actual outlines?
                        - Normally Sprints are just timebound sets of activities, while Epics contain as many sprints needed to actually deliver a feature...
                    - Maybe Epics are actually collections (e.g., Onboarding)?
                        - This isn't action oriented enough...
                    - Maybe we organize at the level of Epics (being questions) and then sprints are just timebound sets of questions...?
                - ---
            - Summarizing, the structure would look something like this...
                - `[[Q:]] What are the fundamental dependent relationships within a knowledge graph?`
                    - **Oriented around:** answering a single focused question such as "#Q What are the fundamental dependent relationships within a knowledge graph?"
                        - "#Q What are the fundamental dependent relationships within a knowledge graph?"
                    - **With status:** `#Sprint/Current`
                    - **Composed of:** a base `#Q` block maturing into a `[[Q:]]` page that at its completion is readily legible to an external audience (with relevant contxt)
                    - **Nested under:** "`Sprint/1`"
                - `Sprint/1`
                    - **Oriented around:** a realistic set of questions to be answered in 7 days time (tentative)
                    - **With status:** `#Sprint/Active`
                    - **Composed of:** multiple questions (`#Q` blocks ‚Üí `[[Q:]]` pages) and an associate set of tasks (e.g., create a template for output or implement roam garden extension)
                    - **Nested under:** "`Epic/How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?`"
                - `Epic/How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?`
                    - **Oriented around:** answering a single broad question such as "#Q How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?"
                    - **With status:** `#Epic/Active`
                    - **Composed of:** two sprints (through next Wednesday & then through next Sunday)
            - Outlining an Epic would proceed like...
                1. Determine broad question to answer during epic
                    - Source of question can be:
                        - External ‚Äî e.g., from a Roam Game
                        - Top Down ‚Äî i.e., question that is determined to be applicable based on some criteria
                        - Bottomw Up ‚Äî i.e., question that precipitates out of the process of speculative outlining / curation
                2. Outline sub-`#Qs` to answer
                    - Aggregate current questions in the graph into an outline
                    - Add additional questions that arise during the curation process
                3. Divide Epic into Sprints
                    - **Note:** An Epic can be a single sprint
                4. Create the appropriate pages
                    - `Epic/ ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî the question goes here? ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî`
                        - `Sprint/N`, `Sprint/N+1`... `Sprint/N+x`
                5. Add the Sprint announcement to the announcement to orient to broader Roam Collective around it!
            - Outlining a Sprint is really just as simple as divvying up work into appropriate buckets (based on dependencies and bandwidth)
            - Epics & Sprints should be aggregate within the [[Backlog]]
                - Utilizing a central repository decreases the search costs to understand the current focus of the graph.
                - The processes to develop questions, outline Epics, and delineate sprints can occur within daily note pages, but once an Epic is queued or is active, the outline should be ported or replicated within the backlog.
            - Question answers should ultimately end up in a `[[Q:]]` page
                - As we work within the graph, it is natural to drop a `#Q` block in-line to ask a topical question.
                    - This is good practice because it is linked into the conversation and gives context around exactly what gave rise to the question.
                - When moving into the drafting phase of an "answer" or synthesis in response to a question, creating a `[[Q:]]` implicitly denotes an increase in maturity

        - On "[[domains]]" within the Roam Collective
            -  [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]] I almost think of [these](((xRXhJOm2O))) as distinct domains ‚Äî meta, internal knowledge, external knowledge.
                - Obviously there is a ton of overlap and exchange between each, but they each have distinct objectives and conventions

        - Notes from the Zoom call
            - CFarr:  Zsolt had done an agile development in Roam.  
                - Can we have series of questions be sprints?
                    - Easy way to structure it, clear entry and end point
                -  PRosso the PPV system - every time you have a task, you have to confront it with pillars you want to achieve.  As a group, you can then decide what becomes active vs not
                    - CFarr that sounds like prioritizing; reminds me of the 12 problems that you're interested in 
                - BToner easy to drive convergence as a sprint - atomization of work
                - PRosso - PPV provides personal pillars and a framework that provides an overview 
                    - GTD Horizons of Focus - maintaining perpetual alignment - especially important when there is a lot of dispersion 
                    - Everytime we create a sprint, you can connect that to your knowledge vault
                    - CFarr what is the atomic structure of the graph, there's the output focused vs. zettelkasten
                        - GTD makes sense for maintenance
                        - While agile and sprint makes more sense for projects
                        - Zettelkasten then is for knowledge management
                - BToner purpose emerging naturally; recurrence of ideas, then that can advise the top part of the system
                - CFarr take an experimental battle-test approach
            - Latest Roam Games -> 
                - PRosso looking at parent-child relationships
                - Explore 
                - CFarr generate set of questions
            - How to implement it?
                - Clear name; standardize
                - What does a successful sprint look like?
                    - Sets of questions 
                - Sprint -> hub -> similar attributes to evergreen -> as you contribute, tag it then compile ideas underneath. 
                    - What we can do
                        - Identify questions
                        - Create speculative outlines
                        - Make assertions
                        - Collaborate as we go on all the above
                    - Then you can use existing tags (q, outline)
                    - MVogel have it top of DN to ensure effectiveness
                    - PRosso create an archive so we know what's been processed
                    - Lower threshold for questions and page ideas
