        - On **RC Conversation conventions**:[*]([[conversation]])[*]([[RC/conversation conventions]])
            - Value comes from:
                - Ability to think out loud, at no-one in particular, while simultaneously holding space for collaboration.
                - Ability to "go off on a tangent" at any time, without taking the conversation off the rails. 
                - Ability to integrate elements of conversation into the ever-growing [[knowledge base]] -- or attach it to active projects and initiatives.
                    - Information can easily be **tended** -- gardening as a team through the act of conversation
                        - Good gardeners look for opportunities to create links that naturally arise through conversation. Tending passively as opportunities arise. This is the main skill that drives the success of a collective graph.[*]([[Bookmarks]])
                - Ability to go as deep and as far down the track on a subject as you are inspired. 
                    - No risk of "taking over" the conversation thread as there is lots of room to move around in here! Conversation diverges and converges as necessary[*]([[Bookmarks]])
                    - Example:: Compare discussion on [these ideas](((JQ-PVpFi4))) here vs in Slack.
                        - I would have NEVER run with the ball so far on this topic within Slack. 
                            - The [[RC/conversation conventions]] here allow for you to effectively run with the ball.
                                - Related:: The idea of [[depth-first leadership]] -- with each member going as far as they can see on any given idea.[*]([[Bookmarks]])
                                    - Is this a real concept, I first heard it mentioned by [Larissa]([[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]]) but can't find a reference... Maybe I misunderstood it at the time.. but I like the idea hahah. 
                                - #FN Traditional [[chat]] interfaces truncate conversational potential by the restricting user's ability to "go off on a tangent" and their ability to link related ideas together.
            - #I We need a keyword for the conversation convention lol... I feel the need to compile discussions on this recurring topic...
                - [[RC/conversation conventions]] -- kinda like the RC namespace for this sort of thing... [@Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]])

            - 10 active users
            - 50 active users 
            - 100 active users 
            - 500 active users
        - **Decision:** I'm going to stop using [[aliases]] for [[chat]]. [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
            - Rationale:: 
                - I want mentions to appear in queries. 
                    - "#Obs Aliased mentions are not showing up in queries."
                - I want to test the [new CSS](((LSEOq9Cyn)))
                    - If it feels too "loud" we can further tame the CSS...
                - Aliases don't visually change when changed to read/saved.
            - Comments::
                - Gah, they still feel quite obtrusive though hahah
                    - I would have definitely buried [this mention](((V77vH8vel))) in an asterisk alias
        - [[directives]] vs [[maxims]] vs [[principles]] vs [[claims]]
            - **Claims**, **maxims/principles**, and **directives** might be all different things! 
            - They all might be sub-types of [[evergreen notes]]
            - #Q What is the difference between a principle and a directive?[*]([[Charles Farr]])
                - [[directives]] lead with a verb.
                - [[maxims]] are generalized or proverbial wisdom.
                - [[claims]] are rational [[arguments]].

        - [@Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) Re: ["Think Tank"](((X9Q366noM)))
            - [Move to graph](((vwOYQBlIF)))
                - Yea I 100% agree. In seeing the initial activity, I've been super anxious thinking of all of the missed potential. A graph would help to bring a stronger perspective across time -- saving ideas and improving serendipities.
                - "[[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] [re](((u3WYIwaTM))) ‚Äî I completely agree. The one thing I will say is the [[velocity of conversation]] is much higher in slack, which is important when you have more people together. This is part of the reason why I'm interested in building a in-graph chat extension for Roam."
                    - Yea, velocity is good. But not great if it's too lossy. I'd say that fast and lossy is much worse for driving progress, outcomes and clarity than slower graph communication.
                    - The value of the graph is that things are **organized** as they are communicated. It bundles those steps -- driving the compounding of ideas across time.
                    - But yea, agree. If we can find ways to make the graph experience more nimble and quick, then that would be a huge advancement. 
                        - Not sure if in-graph chat is the answer though... unless it is effectively tied to documentation conventions. 
                        - If separate and fleeting, Slack can still play that role.  
                        - Interested in hearing more details about your vision for in-graph chat. It's yet to "click" for me haha.
                - "However, these conventions are slow. Instead of an immediate chat, I believe that they are more like writing a letter (snail-mail) or an email. There is great value in this approach, but it does fall short for other types of communication."
                    - #Q Are RC conventions actually slower than other chat options?
                        - Less convenient, yes (mobile, push notifications, etc) -- but I'm not quite convinced on slower.
                            - I think the effect of "slower" might be more related to **notifications** & **getting in-and-out of Roam** vs actual convention speed.
                - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] to your point [here](((JQod1Yt80))), I agree that this method is much stronger. However, the ideas I was building off of were widely shared in a chat form, and then expanded upon. I don't think people's approach to chat is going to change, so it would be worthwhile to bring it into a graph so anyone could then thread off of it!"
                    - Maybe we could simply offer the RC graph as a conversational space in addition to the Slack channel. 
                    - Hosting conversation here (as opposed to another new graph) would also help rest my tension around [community fragmentation](((UPtrVlc29))). 
            - On [personal interests](((_RnYc_LWd)))
                - Perhaps predictably, I am very interested in most of these haha.
        - [[~[[Wade Dominic]]]] on [agile development](((jcFsFvNoY)))[*]([[agile development]])
            - Discussed stories with [Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) last week as they relate to epics ‚Äî and we opted to move towards "projects" as the smaller unit of work as  compared to epics. So stories = **projects** in RC as it currently stands.
            - There is still a fair bit of work to be done to mature and implement the agile framework in RC, but this is something I'm keen to see happen. 
            - The problem is, I am very loose and exploratory in my development style haha ‚Äî so I'm until I catch a wave of clarity on this, I'm not super likely to push it forward. 
            - Part of what is holding me back currently is likely the lack of clarity on overall direction/roadmap. 
            - I'm sort waiting for the epics to form naturally rather than forcing their development... but who knows ‚Äî they might emerge sooner. 
            - "#Q How can we visualise/model the completion of progress made on stories in relation to a sprint but also globally across sprints and epics?"
                - Projects have statuses (on hold, in progress, completed, dropped, someday|maybe) ‚Äî and these projects can easily be linked to one or several epics.
                    - An epic is comprised of multiple projects. 
                    - Sprints help to converge group attention and efforts to one or more projects as dictated by group priorities, interests and timelines.
            - "#Q How do we capture story dependencies? eg Story B depends on A"
                - Manually, this could be done based on a `Dependencies::` attribute on the story (project) page. ‚Äî with the status block reffed on the same line to promote good [visibility](((D3gcKeMVe))) without having to click-in to the project.[*](((4d48_3iGO)))
                    - This manual workflow is likely sufficient until a robust workflow emerges, making room for automation.

        - Thoughts on the discussion happening in the [[Projects/Develop Shared Graph for Roam Think Tank]] slack
            - There are so many fascinating ideas bouncing around in the Slack channel... It really needs to move to a graph, though I think the overall velocity of discussion would diminish, it would be easier to establish continuity...
            - Personal Interests
                - Building conventions to support multiplayer graphs with varying objectives (e.g., shared knowledge synthesis, task & project management, community discussion & engagement, organizational design, etc.)

                    - A notification system ‚Äî identifying when you as a user are mentioned within the graph
                    - In-graph chat ‚Äî implemented as an additional sidebar; would allow for slack style chatting, memorialized within a single location within the graph, including native roam features (page and block referencing)
                - Investigating knowledge frameworks, processes, and frameworks to support shared synthesis (revisions of zettelkasten, question & answer frameworks, analysis on strength of evidence)
                    - Building more verbose mythologies to orient communities around learning objectives

                    - Layer-esque visualization (drawing on attributes)
        - Thoughts on [[in-graph chat]], in-graph snail-mail, and the idea of [[velocity of conversation]]
            - In [[Books/The Culture Code]] author [[Dan Coyle]] mentions that one way to understand the strength of a community is to evaluate the [[velocity of learning]]. Communities with a high velocity of learning are generally stronger.
            - In our experience here, conversation and discussion is a real driver of thought, refinement, and synthesis. I would say that strong conversation (and thinking in public) really accelerates the [[velocity of learning]] (both individually and as a community).
                - #FN The [[velocity of conversation]] within a community is strongly correlated with the [[velocity of learning]]
            - However, the nature of our communication is the [energy required]([[activation energy]]) is higher than other forms communication, such as Slack.
                - As [[Brandon Toner]] rightly [points out](((iexsCPofn))), the fact that communication is slower forces us as a community to better structure what we're sharing, aiding with overall synthesis. I believe that the conventions of the `#Conversation` section are very effective at doing this.
                    - However, these conventions are slow. Instead of an immediate chat, I believe that they are more like writing a letter (snail-mail) or an email. There is great value in this approach, but it does fall short for other types of communication.
            - So, I would propose a second channel for communication ‚Äî an [[in-graph chat]] function.
                - This would allow for rapid communication, which is ideal for certain type of communication.
                - Asking for someone's opinion on an update to the CSS or if they want to find time time connect this week on a specific project are good example of communication that is fleeting and is appropriate for a chat.
                    - See: "[[@[[Samuel Bars]]]] do you want to connect on prototyping a [chat](((Xj3_JaYIm))) function sometime this week?"
                - I also believe that this could lower the bar for broader participation, especially in mid-stream (per [Mark's](((m6u2SPGWP))) question).
                    - Imagine you join the RC graph here after a bit and can ping the chat asking what you should review. It would be possible to get near instantaneous feedback on where to jump in.
            - I think most importantly with the idea of [[in-graph chat]] is that it lives completely within roam.
                - Each chat would be tagged with an author and a time
                    - 12:12 [[Charles Farr]]: This is an example chat
                - Chats would be stored in a single location
                    - [[roam/chat]]
                - Chats would be nested underneath a date
                    - [[March 1st, 2021]]
                        - 12:12 [[Charles Farr]]: This is an example chat [*](((mSXP90Irg)))
                - You could include page references and block references within a chat
                    - 12:13 [[Charles Farr]]: Hey all, can you take a look at my thoughts here: "Thoughts on [[in-graph chat]], in-graph snail-mail, and the idea of [[velocity of conversation]]"
                    - 12:14 [[Charles Farr]]: Much of what I'm writing about is related to [[Books/The Culture Code]]...
            - Ultimately, I think adding this type of communication would be supplemental to the conventions we have now rather than acting as a replacement.
    - #Conversation
        - On Chat with Brandon & Mark
            - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] [re](((u3WYIwaTM))) ‚Äî I completely agree. The one thing I will say is the [[velocity of conversation]] is much higher in slack, which is important when you have more people together. This is part of the reason why I'm interested in building a in-graph chat extension for Roam.
                - See: "#I Create an demo chat interface to demonstrate how native chat in roam could function"
            - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] you make a [good point](((QmZ-dy0U3))) about what is essentially just technical barriers at current. Regardless, I think communicating using block references will always be slower than communicating in a chat thought.
                - I think a big reason why isn't actually the technical capabilities, but the view and layout of the communication. In a chat all you have to do is look up or scroll up, where our current conventions require you to have multiple blocks open.
                - Now, another thing I would love would be some way to toggle visualizations that would essentially thread multiple conversation blocks together. Similar to clicking the references box, but more conversation oriented...
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] to your point [here](((JQod1Yt80))), I agree that this method is much stronger. However, the ideas I was building off of were widely shared in a chat form, and then expanded upon. I don't think people's approach to chat is going to change, so it would be worthwhile to bring it into a graph so anyone could then thread off of it!
            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] regarding [my thoughts](((suZ32Mrpd))), I was thinking something more along the lines of the below...
                - Image::
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FbpryAU5RPE.png?alt=media&token=649e13d3-7a94-41a4-b8a6-17312dbfe640)
                - The components & process underpinning of the above are...
                    - The [[Chatroom]], which would be an embedded chat, allowing users to easily type into the bar.
                        - This window would write into the [[roam/chat]] page, which would essentially serve as a repository of the chat's history
                            - The benefits here are numerous...
                                - Chats can use roams page reference and block reference functions, as the foundation is a block within the [[roam/chat]] page
                                - Graph users could go into block reference a chat block, to thread conversation (either within the Chatroom or on their own conversation page)
                                - Eliminates the split between some IRC chatroom and the graph where work is done...
                - In theory, you could have multiple chats going under different namespaces, such as `roam/chat/Roam Think Tank` or `roam/chat/General Chat`, which would be accessible through `Chatroom/Roam Think Tank` and `Chatroom/General Chat`
                - Ultimately, this would provide most of the benefits of slack or discord without ever leaving the graph... The other upside is the ability to use native roam features within chat, and to use block-references to thread off of chat (either as a conversation or as input into other notes).
                - My intuition is this is technically possible within roam ‚Äî perhaps some [[render]] object could be used to create the Chatrooms?
        - Simple Replies
            - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] [re](((u9YdnOIa6))) ‚Äî my thesis on [[block-level tags]] and generally working and thinking at the [[block-level]] is that doing so is more powerful than working at the page level, because you have direct access to the content.
                - It's a rough theory and I'm interrogating why I believe it. I want to be able to articulate it well, where right now it's really just something that I __feel__.
                - Related::
                    - [[cc:[[Joel Chan]]]]'s thread here is using different language but I believe working on a similar thesis...

            - [[@[[Samuel Bars]]]] do you want to connect on prototyping a [chat](((Xj3_JaYIm))) function sometime this week?
                - Really interested in getting a physical demo / artifact spun up to share the idea and start generating some feedback on it...
                - Check out my thoughts [here](((9SJh9UAcx))) ‚Äî pulled together a janky mockup in figma
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [re: meta namespaces](((X_gthxLfx))) ‚Äî I like RC. In the Agora I used `Graph/` to do the same. Definitely helps to disentangle versus more general [[conversation]] tags...
        - [[Clubhouse]] chat with [[Brandon Toner]]
            - [[maxims]] are similar to [[evergreen notes]] in many ways; similar with [[catch phrases]], [[principles]], etc.
                - easily digestable
                - can build and stack
                - can see where they converge
                - don't need to compete for space, there are a number ways to say the same thing
            - A [[directive]]/[[maxims]]/[[principles]] is a [[claim]] in practice
                - is there a difference here between active and passive?
            - A synthesis note is a mature version of a claim; a maxim is a application of a claim (wisdom centric versus statement of fact centric)
            - maxims and synthesis notes make up the universe of evergreen notes
            - Levels
                - claim (statement of fact) & maxim (application of findings)
                - observations
                - proposition
            - "the most developed approach will be spectrum based"

        - Regarding [[Projects/Develop Shared Graph for Roam Think Tank]] and the complexities of dialogue
            - "I think the effect of "slower" might be more related to **notifications** & **getting in-and-out of Roam** vs actual convention speed."
            - "I think a big reason why isn't actually the technical capabilities, but the view and layout of the communication. In a chat all you have to do is look up or scroll up, where our current conventions require you to have multiple blocks open."
                - I agree with these two points strongly. 
                - But I would disagree with the [latter](((ggdiG2UMw))) at some fundamental level in that conventions could be mediated in the short-term and shaped in the long-term to provide the thread experience. 
                    - More testing would be necessary to work out the intricacies, [but look at this screenshot](((oQnsl-Asr)))

                - [My intuition](((ZYBIgpKx8))), likely not better than yours is absolutely possible. Perhaps even in JS, but definitely in [[roam/render]]. 
                - I take it you shared this with [[Stian H√•klev]] already [[Charles Farr]]?
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] and [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] - I think the [[Projects/Develop Shared Graph for Roam Think Tank]] is calling for your expertise!
            - Looks like [[Roamhacker]] wishes to open a graph for the group. 
            - We are already on [[Discord]] now.

        - In typical [[agile development]] there is stories which are allocated to an epic. This story is then completed in a sprint, carried over to following sprints, or cancelled. But sometimes this story relates to multiple Epics. What is a good way to track the progress of a story between TODO, DOING, DONE. That is captured across sprints on the same and different epics.
            - #Q How can we visualise/model the completion of progress made on stories in relation to a sprint but also globally across sprints and epics?
            - #Q How do we capture story dependencies? eg Story B depends on A
                - how do we visualise story dependencies?
                - When a story is blocked by something. How do we visualise that such that it shows up when looking at a story that depends on it?
