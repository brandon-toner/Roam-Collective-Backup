                - Thats what they are... 
                - I'm a bit concerned about various definitions and meanings associated with the term in the community. It's quite fragmented. Especially with RBCIII, there will be a large cohort of folks who use fleeting notes differently.
        - #[[FN]] Broader adoption of RC conventions will help with inter-graph data sharing.
            - Less conflicts in conventions

        1. [@Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) on [Bookmarks](((HZk-NJWQ8)))
            - Yea, that's true. 
            - If that were a desired function, we could add a `#Bk` or similar abbreviation.
                - Similar to:

        2. [@Sam]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) on [inter-graph conventions](((y4YNcoZ-9)))
            - Yea, there will always be a diversity of graph conventions and I think that's probably healthy. That diversity will lead to the continuous discovery of better and better workflows.
            - What I'm ultimately hoping for are some sort of converting interfaces that can facilitate effective transfer across graphs with different conventions.
                - This feel like a very complicated problem though, with the wide array of user behaviour patterns.
        3. [@Sam]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) Various 
            - "demos, even if totally faked, that show powerful use cases, could get rewards, inspire the roam team, and inspire developers to build"

                - Yea, I've considered the idea before. Basically applying constraints to focus the user experience for certain applications.
                - At times, Roam's scope and potential is __too broad__ for some users to grok its value and utility. 
                - It's only once constraints are implemented that users can "see" the value — once it's applied directly to their use-case. 
                - #[[FN]] system/[[UI]] [[constraints]] focus user behaviour
                    - #[[FN]] more focused products have wider uptake within a given domain. #niche
                    - #[[FN]] collaboration and data compilation is empowered when user behaviours are constrained. #constraints
                        - Due to increased user uptake, a reduced [[learning curve]], and more homogenous user behaviour, #[[FN]] increased user constraints improve the feasibility of systems of collaboration.
            - "For example the questions are really good. Getting into the practice of turning issues/ideas into questions makes it much more inviting for others to give another answer/perspective."

            - roam the protocol
            - block ref things not in the feed = starts a new stream for this and child
                - not for page refs yet
            - demos, even if totally faked, that show powerful use cases, could get rewards, inspire the roam team, and inspire developers to build
            - You could search through feeds
                - db that collects public feeds. Search db name, then search for a keyword
                - would be facilitated if we had standard conventions
            - if block-level tagging conventions were followed in everyone's notes about stuff, you could query critical questions, tangents about a link you put in
        - thoughts on [call with stian](((i4Nep2zgV)))
            - UID thing is powerful
                - If you and a friend receive the same public feed (new submissions to roamgames for ex, or a newsletter), you could block reference it in a private feed with your friend, and it would link correctly on both graphs.
                    - Commenting/referencing blocks from public feeds in a chat with someone, all from within your database!
            - "demos, even if totally faked, that show powerful use cases, could get rewards, inspire the roam team, and inspire developers to build"
                - It's still gonna be some time till they develop the infrastructure and features to make that happen, so the most important thing now is not to make it work, but to figure out how we would do things across databases, what it can be used for, how the UI could look like, etc
                    - and the best way to do so is by making throroughly thought-out demos of how things could be, even if simulated.
                    - We could just re-create a lot of apps in roam, but we have an opportunity here to question existing apps and create better solutions that don't repeat their flaws.
            - Related to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/samuelbars/status/1361669347513614336?s=20), UIs could be decoupled from the normal roam UI
                - #[[FN]] The normal roam UI is just a powerful system of free hierarchies
                - UIs for specific use cases could have reduced functionality and have special extensions activated (unique css and js features), and they would use the [normal roam graph and UI](((ZmC71tQ_R))) as a storage system.
                    - Trying to articulate this clearly.
                    - Blocks can inputed in a certain UI, but then manipulated, referenced and re-used in other tasks you do in the usual UI
                        - For example, chat is like slack or whatever, but then you can reference messages in your fleeting notes and stuff like this
                        - You could have a "therapy" app with content and writing prompts (like the excellent Intellect app on android), in a calming / feature-light UI.
                            - Different UIs induce different modes of attention
                            - Reflection/introspection by going over previous journaling sessions, seeing patterns with block refs, etc, could be done at another time, with the full-blow roam features
        - Acronyms for collaborative work used by two marketers, Andre Chaperon and Shawn Twing (part of the very few I really like) [cc]([[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]])

                - __As part of our collaboration, André and I use several acronyms in our
communications.__
                - __For example, ^^NPO means 'no pride of ownership' — that's our way of saying we've
done our best with a piece of writing and we're handing it off to be improved
by the other person^^.__
                - __TOL means 'thinking out loud' — that's a signal that whatever follows isn't yet fully formed. It's a work in progress (and often the freedom of thinking out
loud is what leads to significant insights).__
        - "#Q How might [[Roam Portal]] be used in RC?" [°]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]])
            - Show a google earth type map to see where every graph is, on the globe
            - Haven't understood all the specifics of how it works, but might be possible to highlight areas of high activity in the graph
                - I know you can see which pages have the biggest word count, but not sure if you can see which page (or even block) __references__ (a block with `[[Sprints/1 — Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)]]` and it's children for ex.) have the biggest word count.
                - Would be interesting to see which blocks are referenced the most
                    - First results would be the DNP tags obviously, but what comes after is interesting.
            - In the rbc demo, I remember being surprised that it had access to much more data than I thought it could. **There's potential here to resurface relevant things**, but that depends on specifics of what it can do, and heavily depends on graph conventions too.
        - "#Q How can we make the community notes section more rich and comprehensive?" [°]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]])
            - As prompts, surfacing interesting fleeting notes and questions is great I think. And somehow would be good to remove pressure to catch with everything, have the mindset of "take a look at main feed, and start riffing/sharing ideas on the prompts that resonate with you"
                - The collective zettelkasten as a source for prompts to drive reflection, discussion, and ideas, on shared paths.
                    - The value of collective vs private zettelkasten lies in the discussion (with different perspectives, claims, and answers) around the same questions/themes
                        -  #Q How can we increase the discussion starting from each other's fleeting/literature/permanent notes and questions in a collective zettelkasten

                    - I read a few chapters, skimmed a bit part of it, but yeah I've been slacking a bit 
                - There are group readings at 3:30am on mondays, so I didn't join, and I forgot about checking the other group that popped up for accessible timezones
        - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) about [tweeting thoughts about the graph](((IYSIt3usl)))
            - Would be cool if we could share some interesting lines of thought/conversation from the discussions here.
                - What do you think about integrating the plugin to send tweets from the db?
                    - Conventions could be
                        - Tweet things from your dnp only, but you can integrate block refs
                        - Make a second version of the block and children you wanna tweet, format so that it works with the plugin and add links (QT and else)/gifs/image.
                        - Then click send, and go back to original version so the linking and hierarchy keeps respecting graph conventions (so that queries and all that keep working)
        - [@B]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) about [scaling adoption of RC conventions](((ct3Iw8fLY)))
            - Seems like https://roamlab.org/ from [[Kyle Stratis]] is also going to experiment with conventions, and maybe stumble on different ones? What's your take, thoughts, on this?
                - It's possible that other projects emerge with people sharing a bunch of conventions different to the ones in RC. This can complicate future inter-graph sharing
        - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) & [@Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) on [this](((4jsJ-Oqrk))) and [this](((XUr-8JBw_)))
            - I agree with you two on this, I enjoy the use of block-level tags to articulate/define your thought process.
                - For example the questions are really good. Getting into the practice of turning issues/ideas into questions makes it much more inviting for others to give another answer/perspective.

                - Each chat would be registered with a member page, e.g., `Chat/[[Charles Farr]]`
                - Chat would live in an archive page `[[roam/chat]]`
                    - #Q Should chat be immutable?
                        - Leaning yes actually...
                - On archive page, chat blocks would look like...
                    - 09:58 | `Chat/[[Charles Farr]]:` This is my message here
                        - "09:59 | I like this structure"
                - Could add a reply / thread feature (imagining it as a button in chat)
                    - 09:59 | I like this structure
                        - With a reference inserted below the reply (see: [here](((m_ILKnQkg))))
                    - There are other ways this could be organized
                - Pros
                    - Easy, real time communication — archived within the graph
                    - Foundation as blocks allows for easy use of block references in chat (aliased or not)
                    - Preservation as blocks allows for easy referencing for chat blocks elsewhere in the graph (such as in scratchpad)
                    - Could easily integrate with "#I JavaScript plugin to assist with in-graph communication — access to all member mention pages using some simple trigger — e.g., `@@`"
                - Cons
                    - ...
            - #I JavaScript plugin to assist with in-graph communication — access to all member mention pages using some simple trigger — e.g., `@@`
                - Aggregates list of members either using directory or a tag (e.g., `#[[Members]]`)
                - Allows for easy referencing of members through the `@@` trigger (drop down that only pull up members)
                - Utilizing some sort of tag cycling to easily allow for shift between Unseen → CC: → Read → Saved → Unseen ...
                - Could be based on aliases...

            - {{character-count}}
                - For Roam Games 3, Roam Collective has built The Roaman Agora, a public graph to aggregate information on submissions and related projects, in addition to fostering discussion around these submissions.

You can view the Agora and sign up for access here!

            - {{character-count}}
                - The Agora comes out of Roam Collective's experimentation with a multiplayer Roam environment over the past month or so.

In the process, we've coalesced around a few conventions that support really fruitful in-graph conversation and discussion.
            - {{character-count}}
                - On of the biggest [[takeaways]] is that in-graph conversation is a hugely powerful mechanism for generating divergence and subsequent convergence. So much so that we want to foster it more broadly!

                - Brandon summarized RC's progress here...

            - {{character-count}}
                - So our submission for Roam Games III is the Roaman Agora, a public graph designed to:

1) Collate Roam Games submissions, tracking dependencies and influence...
2) Foster further conversation and discussion around the submissions...
3) Harness the resulting feedback loop...
            - {{character-count}}
                - Collecting submissions in a single graph allows for easier tracking of dependencies, a core focus for RGIII.

It also enables discussions that span and tie together disparate submissions, projects, and contributors. Ultimately, this is what we're most excited about.
            - {{character-count}}
                - These broad discussion create a positive feedback loop. As new ideas and questions emerge, the community can grapple with them, and the resulting insights feeds back into development of new Roam capabilities (conventions, tools, use-cases...), as well as new questions & ideas.
            - {{character-count}}
                - Through this cycle, we hope these in-graph conversations influence future Roam Game submissions and projects. With submissions ~generally~ centralized, dependency tracking emerges naturally...
            - {{character-count}}
                - Right now, the Agora is in its MVP state. Most of the conventions are manual to a degree, but we are excited for it to expand in a variety of ways...
            - {{character-count}}
                - The most exciting is integrating @houshuang's roam-inter. Doing so would allow for submitters (and other project owners) to push updates to the Agora. Similarly, the Agora could publish key questions & updates for subscribers to grapple with in their own graphs.
            - {{character-count}}
                - The Roam Collective team has a bunch of other topics we are planning to pursue — better communication tools, shared zettelkastens, asynchronous & distributed project management.

Some of which will inevitably make its way to the Agora.
            - {{character-count}}
                - Additionally, as part of Roam Collective's submission for RGIII, we plan to package the conventions, CSS, and the FAQs that underpin the Agora into a "seedpack" for easy reuse in other graphs.

The hope is it lowers the bar for other communities to stand up their own multiplayer graphs.
