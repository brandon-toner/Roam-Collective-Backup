        - [@Brandon]([[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]) About [writing on daily pages vs your own](((dakVN3D1r)))
            - When the amount of active users increases and the daily page starts getting overwhelming.
                - In Roam Book Club, every daily writing template is tagged with the day, so you have daily activity, but in linked refs (easily collapsible to prevent lagging)
            - When you want to use the daily page to focus attention on announcements or daily activities.
                - It can become the place where you check what members shouldn't miss.
                    - Seems like the announcements page is filling that role here.
