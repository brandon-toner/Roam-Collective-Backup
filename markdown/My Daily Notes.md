- Using the `#[[My Daily Notes]]` tag #Processes
    - When writing on the daily page, type `#[[My Daily Notes]]` followed by your page. 
    - Nest all of your notes under that block.
    - **Optional**: Use some of the other tags to further organize your thoughts. 
        - Using these other tags is not necessary, but helps to better compile information for filtering and querying. 
    - #Tips
        - Use the [default template](((qONZuXh3Y))) or build your own to make populating your DNP section easier. 
        - Use `#not-populated` in your template to avoid creating [[empty references]]
    - Example::
        - This example is QUITE developed. You could simply nest your ideas underneath the `#[[My Daily Notes]]` header — without organization under other tags. 

As you get comfortable with the available tags, I'd recommend using them to help with data navigation and compilation.

                    9. Added #[[Q]]
                        - Questions that come up while answering a prompt. They don't stand alone so don't work well as open questions — but they are helpful to tag so that you can review the references on those tags. These are great opportunities for collaborative commentary. ((This feels kinda confusing — happy to elaborate on it if unclear.))

                    11. Added #[[Everyone]] tag

                    11. {{[[TODO]]}} Improve [[roam/css]] styling (make it more consistent and easy on the eyes)
                        - Background colour consistency... Dark grey vs light grey — what's the distinction?

                - Thoughts about [Roam Collective]([[About Roam Collective]])
                    - Mission:: ((See block references for additional ideas.))
                        - To define an approach for effective collaboration in Roam.
                    - Vision:: ((See block references for additional ideas.))
                        - A space that is able to asynchronously host collaboration towards a common goal. 
                        - Members of the space adhere to shared conventions that facilitate clear and orderly communication. 
                        - It is easy to tell what is going on. 
                        - It is easy to contribute.
                        - It is accessible to "intermediate users" 
                    - Conversation::
                        - Seeding graphs
                            - How can we effectively "seed" graphs with baseline information?
                                - Depending on features used, JSON or markdown exports should work relatively well for this.
                                    - When cross-graph linking comes, it could be as simple has hosting a source graph.
                - #[[Roam Enhancement Requests]]
                    - Ability to assign SOME users with global editing privileges
                        - Goal: Some can edit ANY block. Some can ONLY edit their own
                - [[chat]] and [[notifications]] #Conventions
                    - Originally, I liked this syntax: `[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]` (from [[[[Roam Book Club]] II]]), but I kinda like this one `[[@]]`... 
                        - The latter gives you the ability to view ALL UNREADS across the graph. Plus, you can still filter `[[@]]` by your name to find YOUR unreads.

                            - Speaking the same language - shared conventions.
                            - Synchronous still necessary (**for moderation and alignment?**)

            - #[[The Zettelkasten]]
                1. #[[N]] [Block references]([[block references]]) are key within a [collaborative graph]([[collaborative graphs]]). Non-intrusive commentary — the original context is preserved.
                2. #[[N]] Strong conventions within a [collaborative graph]([[collaborative graphs]]) help to maintain [[order]] and mitigate [[chaos]].
                3. #[[N]] The biggest hurdle is in ESTABLISHING shared conventions. Once they are set and understood, the system fades, and emphasis directs towards the content.
                4. #[[Questions]] How can we prevent a collaborative graph from feeling overwhelming?
                    - Maybe through strong onboarding? Clubhouse calls to address questions? Encouraging the use of the `#Questions` to create dialogue about conventions.
                5. #[[N]] The Zettelkasten might be the best place for open questions... as they can be blended with assertions and other ideas. Less filing burden ("where does this go?").
                6. #I — Might change `#Comments` to `#Commentary`... feels more clear that it's commentary on stuff within the graph. #Conventions
            - #Promptstorming
                1. From the [[Prompts]] page: What types of products or outcomes could collaborative communities work towards? How might this look?
                    - For book club:
                        - Book reading companion
                            - Thinking of something like what [[Sam Marfleet]] made for [[Books/Hero of a Thousand Faces]]...
                        - Study guide
                1. What goals or objectives would you like to work towards with [[Roam-Collective]]? [*](((ODwYwd-L7)))
                    - To create a [[Roam Collaboration Guide]] that can be used to support multiplayer Roam communities.
                3. From the references on `[[Open Questions]]`: What is the best method of notifications?
                    - The `@` and `~` convention from [[[[Roam Book Club]] II]] seemed to work well.
                    - #[[Q]] Is this only possible if "only edit your blocks" is disabled?
                4. How to tag ideas related to graph conventions and processes?
                    - Under `[[[[Feedback]]: [[Suggestions]]]]`?
                5. How important is it to stick to vanilla Roam?
            - #Conversation
                1. [[~]][[Brandon Toner]] any blocks you create we can't edit/delete — just something to keep in mind (see the duplicate comments and feedback sections below) — fixed
                1. [[~]] [[Brandon Toner]] how do you feel about using templates? I like these daily note headings — I think using either templates or smartblocks could be great to standardize structure... Love templates, they help to facilitate structure — started some [here]([[Graph/Templates]])
                    - Feel free to add some! You could make a `#Templates` section in your DNP section, and create some [[SmartBlocks]] there #Processes #templates
                1. Added [[roam/css]]
                    - I copy/pasted from another shared graph so I'm not sure what's there yet haha. Will sift through later.
                2. **Creating new pages.** All new pages should be ^^LOWERCASE^^, except:
                    - I know this sounds restrictive, but it is really important to compile ideas optimally. 
                    - Nothing will "break" if you don't follow this, but it will lead to a bunch of sorta-related page names and some missed connections.
                3. [[Woah]] the new "unread block references" feature is AWESOME!! 
                6. [[~]] [[Brandon Toner]] Also, think that it could be valuable to build out a tag for relevant references or resources. Ideally these would be ones related to the goals of the graph...
                    - Yup this is a great idea. 
                    - Maybe `#Resources`? [[~]][[Charles Farr]]
                        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] This would work. In my personal graph is use block level tags to identify resources and then aggregate them in a central location...
                            - Yup, this is exactly the workflow I have in mind! 
Community suggests via block-level tagging, then graph editors compile them centrally. 
                7. Just created my bio page at this point. Still reading through the extensive documentation 🤣
                    - I just thinned it out a bunch haha
            - #Chat
                - Thoughts on this? [[~]][[Charles Farr]], [[Everyone]]: Block ref the sections to add your ideas around mission, vision, purpose, goals, etc.
                    - Feels like a good way to converge ideas on something. 
                    - Note the use of the (()) symbol on [[About Roam Collective]]
                - [[~]][[Charles Farr]] — Added [[Roam Collaboration Guide]] as a target artifact for this group. My thoughts is that if we can work to collaborate towards a finished product here, we can port the processes into [[Roam Book Club]] and other communities. 
                    - My thoughts on process: #Processes
                        - Use block references to the table of contents to gather ideas on the content of each section
                        - Editors help to compile the content within the references into the contents of each section
                        - Synchronous conversation (Clubhouse) and Slack can be used to iron out any points of contention.
