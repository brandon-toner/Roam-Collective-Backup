        1. On [[Live Preview]] [[cc:[[Matthew Vogel]]]], [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] 
            - The best way to achieve that is to keep live preview deactivated on hover, and to use `ctrl + hover` to trigger the preview — works well for on-demand preview.
        2. Simple replies
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Damn, I should have [checked](((uQo0I4CWK))). Did you try to ask anyone at Roam?"
                - I haven't in a while, but will at the next opportunity.

        - Flowchart of information / weekly reviwes
            - Where should information aim to be stored at the end of each review cycle.
            - All conversations should either be archived,  forgotten or brought to a note level which allows people to get the gist of the conclusion drawn.
        - Can we formalize what we are learning about the collective?
            - I wonder what level of reporting we could do to turn this is a proper experiment. Publishable research is a good advertisement for rc. Is there any social scientist/ system-oriented researcher int the collective?

        - I love [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]'s idea of [specific tags](((cfEfYDOAh))) `#Broadcast / #Radio / #Vote` resurfacing using smart blocks. I wish [status flag](((hj8c8eDin))) could be set using drop down menu. That way we are sure that people always set a status.  — cc: [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[@[[leekeifon]]]] [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Damn, I should have [checked](((uQo0I4CWK))). Did you try to ask anyone at Roam?
        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] Can [live preview](((Ue69JZ6i5))) be used only on specific blocks/pages? e.g. only on evergreen notes?
            - "[[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] No, live preview is for all pages. I don't think there's currently a way to only preview evergreen notes. [*](((hZjna0IrM)))"
                - #[[Roam Enhancement Requests]] Preview of specific pages that contains a chosen tag
        - [[@[[leekeifon]]]] and that is [very clear definition](((1dcTvgxys))) that for some reason I missed - rereading your thoughts today, sorry!
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] We can start [setting up the website](((m-bFHWp73))) either using a service like wordpress/squareplace or building one and hosting it on https://app.netlify.com/ for a start.
            - Ideally, it would be nice to be able to use specific pages in the graph as a way to publish blog posts on the website.
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] [Version control works](((SHRExdEg8))) for any bloc, not only code.

        - [[@[[leekeifon]]]] [*](((rUTsMbOZ8))) I know some people do this with chrome plugins like RoamThemes and Stylish. I'm sure those could be ported over to roam/js but would probably be time consuming for minimal gain in my opinion.

        - Reviewing onboarding & meta-structure
            - Feedback: [[Quick Start Guide]]
                - Details should be embedded in the page — easier to read versus multiple links
                - Add block reference to all of the Roam js that is needed to be activated
                - Split the sections up a bit more...

                    - Start writing
            - Feedback: [[Welcome 😃]]
                - Welcome should provide an answer the "what" and "why" of Roam Collective, provide a few examples of the awesome conversations and content we're building, and then link to the various "how" pages
                    - How to use basic features
                    - How to use more complex features

                    - etc...
            - Feedback: [[right sidebar]]
                - Strip out all of the pages below FAQ
                - Create a new page called "The Hub" that indexes all of the critical pages (projects, important tags, etc.)
            - Feedback: `#Announcements`
                - Slim down total announcements — too much detail gets lost
            - Addition: Onboarding "AoT"
                - Re: "[[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] almost like a onboarding algorithm... Going to identify this as a #[[Follow Up]] because I want to think about it a bit more"
                - The idea would be to inject fresh perspective into the graph, before new users have been assimilated!

        - Chat with [[Brandon Toner]]
            - How do we inspire convergence in the Collective?
                - Activity: Pick a topic and just focus on curating around that topic
                    - Reflect on the topics and conversations that have taken place
                - Curation creates proximity, which naturally leads to convergence
                - Speculative outlining and curation of collections in parallel with more divergent activities allows for easier convergence
                - Collective convergence benefits from synchronous
