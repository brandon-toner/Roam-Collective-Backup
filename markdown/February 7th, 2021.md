        - 06:06 conditioning or â€˜steelingâ€™ myself against [[pain]] is numbing myself. iâ€™m better off â€˜feelingâ€™ the pain, accepting and embracing what it brings instead. after all iâ€™m in a relationship with experience and pain is a type of experience.
        - 06:46 today, i'm copy-pasting [[Peter Rosso]]'s template till i can figure out how to invoke it with a command
        - typing this with a [[colemak]] keyboard is frustrating and excruciatingly slow. on mobile i still use swipe to type, so i'm blisteringly fast, which makes this so much more frustrating
        - also clueless about the rest of the tags below but they are colorful and pretty

You will find information regarding the [meaning of each tag](((XW6KutyOv))) and you should find information on [how to create your own smart block](((gMGp4oTIC))).

        - Works for me! Thanks [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]! [*](((shPwbVEW0)))
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] Heads up I messed up a little when setting up the [[Projects/Establish automated graph backups]]. Apparently using macOS to do the backups is expensive (1 run minute costs 10 minutes???). Live and learn! Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
            - A user gets 2000 free run minutes a month and mine are close to running out ðŸ˜¬. Check the repo for an incoming PR to fix this
