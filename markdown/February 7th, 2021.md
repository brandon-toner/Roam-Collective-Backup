        1. Last night I ([Charles]([[Charles Farr]])) wrote about mythologies of notes — I would love to get **everyone's** thoughts on refactoring our current note structure → see "Thinking on objectives and the relationship to mythology"
            - **Brandon:** This is a great summary of ideas, Charles. Still percolating my thoughts around it all, but have bookmarked it with Follow Up to continue to think it through. While foundational, I think we can maintain course as we have been until clarity strikes. [*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])
            - **Larissa:**  Strongly agree with "Mythologies are so often chosen based on the type of work we're trying to do" [*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])
                - Touches on the point re: what are the objectives?  Is it just to build a guide?  
                    - The reason I struggle with that is that tools and process for collaboration depend on the desired output.  Do we aim to create a guide that works for all types of collaboration?   
        2. Some outlines on [structure and process](((W8X67wb_G))) for Roam Collective
            - Purpose: 
                - Create some structure that can serve to keep us oriented and aligned.
                - A step towards building something to publish for the greater community.
            - Goal: Build out the outline through collective brainstorming (What's missing?)
            - Next: 
                - Use that outline to go a level deeper (outline each section).
                - Create documentation that reflects the content.
        3. **Goal:** [Refresh the FAQs and Prompts](((FfZu-AqGj)))
I think the FAQs could be a lot more relevant, and the Prompts more usable (maybe fewer, better ones?)
            - **Larissa:**  
                - Re: FAQs:  think we should add in [norms](((CaGPiJ2TS)))
                    - Personally, also love [this](((2iqWWvBph))) and would suggest adding it as a norm - as it also provides "permission" to suggest and improve wherever an opportunity is observed
                - Re: Prompts: should we have a process to connect the prompts and the set of [open questions](((rQhJBlEnm)))? and perhaps a process to mark questions as "resolved"?

        - 06:06 conditioning or ‘steeling’ myself against [[pain]] is numbing myself. i’m better off ‘feeling’ the pain, accepting and embracing what it brings instead. after all i’m in a relationship with experience and pain is a type of experience.

        - typing this with a [[colemak]] keyboard is frustrating and excruciatingly slow. on mobile i still use swipe to type, so i'm blisteringly fast, which makes this so much more frustrating

            - "Strong conventions at the start hare a huge help. Potentially a short period at the start of the graph inception (2 days?) where fundamental conventions can be challenged." -> We should layer conventions so that people both get the endorphin kick of ticking a todo list, but also they understand to what extent their understanding of the "rules"
            - "Being overwhelmed by the daily notes page was a common sentiment among the group." -> We could  add a free writing section in the collective daily page. No rules to release the tension?

        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] [*](((KJ2FvCNN3))) Harmful for two reasons. Quantity does not mean quality. And fear to fail and being observed is a limiting factor to the freedom people feel in expressing their mind. What I am trying to say with the second point is that we might preclude yourself from exploring ideas which disagree with the main ideas.
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Are you familiar with the concept of Architects, Gardeners and Librarians? Brandon Sanderson and George RR Marting use this pretty much self-explanatory ideas to describe writers. [*](((ymhg0zmwY)))
            - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] Roam offers a [[selection bias]] towards "gardeners" [*]([[architects, gardeners, and librarians]])."
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [*](((cxyHE-hYX))) It depends. On a day to day basis people should follow their own rhythms for maximal output. Though deadlines on output could require synchronous convergence.

    - #Scratchpad ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))
        - Yesterday I introduced [[Multiplayer Roam]] to a small group of ~10 people who had little to no experience with multiplayer graphs and it was heartening to see how excited it made them and what kinds of questions they had.
            - Questions included:
                1. Do I need to be a paying roam user to use a multiplayer graph?
                    - ie if they are not sold on Roam as a whole for personal use but want to contribute to a graph
                2. One member expressed a worry that being presented with such a 'blank canvas' would drive them to endlessly tweak the conventions and interface looking for the 'best' system
                    - I talked about light social pressure on a multiplayer graph; it's similar to not wanting to deface a shared common area for risk of adversely affecting your peers.
                    - Multiplayer graphs historically have been strong places of democratic process; ideas are presented and discussed before being made (__usually__)
                    - Strong conventions at the start hare a huge help. Potentially a short period at the start of the graph inception (2 days?) where fundamental conventions can be challenged.
            - There was a strong sense of being intimidated by multiplayer graphs, even by people with an understanding of Roam. Having small guided tours of the graph helped alleviate those worries. 
                - This is probably not possible with larger graphs but I could see it working very well with smaller ones
            - Being overwhelmed by the daily notes page was a common sentiment among the group.
                - I like the [[[[Roam Book Club]] III]] approach of putting daily notes on a person's personal page and leaving the daily notes page for group communication, [[Prompts]], etc. 
                    - This put's everyone's notes in the references instead of directly on the daily notes
            - I was surprised how unexcited they were about searching across the graph for adjacent blocks using double brackets `(( ))`. My guess is that the true power of this isn't clear until you've experienced the serendipity yourself 
            - My instinct says we need to foster a strong sense of exploration with new members. Create → Explore → Engage → Create
                - {{[[diagram]]}}
                    - Create
                    - Explore
                    - Engage
    - #Questions ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) 
        - ~~Would a block creation leaderboard be fun or harmful? (ie top writers and block creators on a multiplayer graph)~~
            - This could turn the graph into more of a game similar to the Fitbit leaderboard. Could also be harmful pressure "My contribution is so small and not worth it"
                - It's hard to quantify the value of an idea. A single idea/block could spawn dozens of blocks. Hmm maybe blocks with the most refs...
    - #Conversation 
        - Works for me! Thanks [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]! [*](((shPwbVEW0)))
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Heads up I messed up a little when setting up the [[Projects/Establish automated graph backups]]. Apparently using macOS to do the backups is expensive (1 run minute costs 10 minutes???). Live and learn! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
            - A user gets 2000 free run minutes a month and mine are close to running out 😬. Check the repo for an incoming PR to fix this
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [*](((sHV6egRKL)))It's on your account settings page under **billing**→**usage this month**→**actions**
        - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] I think this is a good impulse, especially since the multiplayer [[Roam Games]] is closing soon [*](((gYGadCTR3)))
            - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] Information overload is right! I'm in the same boat honestly. There's been an incredible amount writing and conventions developed in this graph so far. [*](((FqyiA2fgt)))
            - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] Haha I came to the same conclusion as you were typing a response [*](((tvvL44n95)))

        - #Resources 
            - Interested in [[Mat McGann]]'s work on collaborative Roaming. 
                - He has been running his business in Roam, with his team — as a collaborative graph. 
                - He published a database explaining these practices. More on that [here](https://twitter.com/matmcgann/status/1358416938129453062?s=21).
                - Here is the link to that [graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/multiplayerknowledgebases/page/tIRpxfXyY). It's impressive.
                - {{[[TODO]]}} Review Mat's graph for lessons that can apply to Roam Collective.  #[[Help Wanted]]
        - #Q How do you confront feelings of [[chaos]] and overwhelm? 
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Find the biggest rock you can lift, and carry it. #responsibility
                - #Q How does this apply to Roam Collective?
                    - Convergence and finding a sense of order is everyone's collective responsibility.
                    - If things feel chaotic, find something you can [[clarify]] and bring into [[order]].
                    - Ask:
                        - What feels unclear? — write that down.
                            - Then reflect on how it could be more clear.
                                - What decisions need to be made? 
                                - What material needs to be summarized?
        - #Q Should phases of [[divergence]] and [[convergence]] be at the same time for all graph members? Or should the individual oscillate though those cycles independent of the group?[*]([[[[E:]] cycles of divergence and convergence]]) #order #chaos
            - Thoughts::
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Freedom of expression is fun.
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Fun drives productivity and engagement.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Individuals have varying thresholds for tolerance of [[chaos]].
                - It is easier to follow the rules when there are less of them.
                - If each individual uses their own intuition as guide for navigating balance, then the whole will benefit. 
                - Global phases of divergence and convergence could be offered, and followed loosely. 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] "[[ride the lightning]]" as a mode of action.
                    - Run with [[inspired action]] as it strikes.
                    - [[non-coercive]] [[productivity]].
                    - #Q What happens when everyone rides the lightning. 
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Roam was built to empower a "[[ride the lightning]]" workflow.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Find order through collective chaos. 
                - As we all ride the lightning, patterns emerge naturally; we improve the surface-area for [[serendipity]]  and [[alignment]].
                - Work independently together, and leverage moments of serendipitous alignment.
                    - Global [[purpose]], [[goals]], and [[vision]] narrows the space that we oscillate around. It creates a lens to think and act through.
                        - Any group action in alignment with the group goals will improve the likelihood of synergy of ideas.
            - A collective graph as a chaotic [[playground]]. 
                - Objective: constrain the chaos through a shared lens.
                    - Like gas within a space, the chaotic energy should fill the space it is given. 
                    - #Q How is chaos tamed?
                        - Conventions, norms, objectives, and methods of gaining spatial awareness.
        - #I I suspect that there is an association between an individual's personality and their propensity to gravitate towards various graph activities and roles.

        1. Simple Replies
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [*](((cxyHE-hYX))) It depends. On a day to day basis people should follow their own rhythms for maximal output. Though deadlines on output could require synchronous convergence."
                - Agreed. I think objectives and targets help to align individual work with collective goals. [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]]
            - "Tweet referring to Conor 😅 [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
                - Great thread [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]]. 
                - What were you big takeaways? 
                    - Seems like Conor/Roam have used systems similar to what we have in place here. 
                    - I think our notification are better than "the dropzone"
                    - Interesting to hear that Conor views multiplayer as aberration haha
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I started using an attribute — I hope I don't come to [regret](((xaNyqoEJT))) it lol"
                - hahaha
            - [On reviews and maintainence](((b5_pXqQgk)))[*]([[@[[Peter Rosso]]]]), [*]([[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]).
                - Right now, my thought is to think as if things everything is fleeting — making links to promote eventual resurfacing in the right contexts.
                - While I love the idea of weekly/monthly reviews — I rarely have the discipline to actually follow through on them. 
                    - (I just may not be the one to lead it off, though — I def see value in reviews, just don't have the bandwidth for a more disciplined approach quite yet.)
                - Part of what I like about Roam is the ability to rely on things circulating back at the right time — a reliance on serendipity. 
                - This requires both some detachment and some faith in the magic junkyard lol.
                - I did some thinking on overall [structure and process](((W8X67wb_G))), and I think the next step is to start to build that out a bit to formalize it.
                - Once we get over this hurdle (defining structure and process), then we likely enter the phase of **engaging with** those processes, primarily knowledge development, and productivity (working on projects and outputs).
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] We can start [setting up the website](((m-bFHWp73))) either using a service like wordpress/squareplace or building one and hosting it on https://app.netlify.com/ for a start."
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] did some more tweaking of CSS, interested in your thoughts. We may be getting into overload territory with to many tweaks from vanilla for new users [*](((uiP-kSPjh)))"
                - I don't think we're overboard. Most CSS adjustments have been little tweaks here and there. I think there is room left for more customization if we feel it helpful. Not scared of it. [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
        2. On a RC Website #Bookmarks #[[February 2021]]

            - "22:12 can i gatecrash into other's daily notes and start riffing, taking off on a tangent or playing in tandem?"
                - Absolutely! Just take a block reference of the part that catches your attention, paste it into your section — and nest all of your thoughts on that idea and beyond [[@[[Reddy2Go]]]]
        4. On [[GitHub]] minute budget
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Heads up I messed up a little when setting up the [[Projects/Establish automated graph backups]]. Apparently using macOS to do the backups is expensive (1 run minute costs 10 minutes???). Live and learn! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
                - Where do I check my minutes usage? Can't seem to find. [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
                - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [*](((sHV6egRKL)))It's on your account settings page under **billing**→**usage this month**→**actions**"
                    - I bought 1 month of premium last week to navigate an overage... but usage seems down since. I'll keep an eye as I enter next month. Thanks! [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]]

            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Are you familiar with the concept of Architects, Gardeners and Librarians? Brandon Sanderson and George RR Marting use this pretty much self-explanatory ideas to describe writers. [*](((ymhg0zmwY)))"
                - I have heard that! That's the exact vein I was thinking in. Thanks for the reference. I couldn't quite place it. 
                - Yea, I have a feeling this is quite applicable. Gonna think on this. [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]]

        - On BToner's [structure and process](((W8X67wb_G)))
            - Worth thinking through time dimension across different process activities - as that can help think through whether/how diff steps in the process help with convergence vs. divergence 
                - e.g., when is purpose defined vs. revisited?  what about project creation vs. review?

                - Wonder what informs that hypothesis for you  
                - My anecdotal evidence points to the opposite, with Roam the dream tool for architects, as it allows creation and co-existence of multiple structures to achieve simultaneously.  
        - On [output channel](((pjCpYAPW4)))
            - [[@[[Peter Rosso]]]] would be happy to pitch in! [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]]
