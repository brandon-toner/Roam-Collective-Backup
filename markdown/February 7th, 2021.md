        - 06:06 conditioning or â€˜steelingâ€™ myself against [[pain]] is numbing myself. iâ€™m better off â€˜feelingâ€™ the pain, accepting and embracing what it brings instead. after all iâ€™m in a relationship with experience and pain is a type of experience.

            - "Being overwhelmed by the daily notes page was a common sentiment among the group." -> We could  add a free writing section in the collective daily page. No rules to release the tension?

    - #Scratchpad ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))
        - Yesterday I introduced [[Multiplayer Roam]] to a small group of ~10 people who had little to no experience with multiplayer graphs and it was heartening to see how excited it made them and what kinds of questions they had.
            - Questions included:
                1. Do I need to be a paying roam user to use a multiplayer graph?
                    - ie if they are not sold on Roam as a whole for personal use but want to contribute to a graph
                2. One member expressed a worry that being presented with such a 'blank canvas' would drive them to endlessly tweak the conventions and interface looking for the 'best' system
                    - I talked about light social pressure on a multiplayer graph; it's similar to not wanting to deface a shared common area for risk of adversely affecting your peers.
                    - Multiplayer graphs historically have been strong places of democratic process; ideas are presented and discussed before being made (__usually__)
                    - Strong conventions at the start hare a huge help. Potentially a short period at the start of the graph inception (2 days?) where fundamental conventions can be challenged.
            - There was a strong sense of being intimidated by multiplayer graphs, even by people with an understanding of Roam. Having small guided tours of the graph helped alleviate those worries. 
                - This is probably not possible with larger graphs but I could see it working very well with smaller ones
            - Being overwhelmed by the daily notes page was a common sentiment among the group.
                - I like the [[[[Roam Book Club]] III]] approach of putting daily notes on a person's personal page and leaving the daily notes page for group communication, [[Prompts]], etc. 
                    - This put's everyone's notes in the references instead of directly on the daily notes
            - I was surprised how unexcited they were about searching across the graph for adjacent blocks using double brackets `(( ))`. My guess is that the true power of this isn't clear until you've experienced the serendipity yourself 
            - My instinct says we need to foster a strong sense of exploration with new members. Create â†’ Explore â†’ Engage â†’ Create
                - {{[[diagram]]}}
                    - Create
                    - Explore
                    - Engage
    - #Questions ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) 
        - ~~Would a block creation leaderboard be fun or harmful? (ie top writers and block creators on a multiplayer graph)~~
            - This could turn the graph into more of a game similar to the Fitbit leaderboard. Could also be harmful pressure "My contribution is so small and not worth it"
                - It's hard to quantify the value of an idea. A single idea/block could spawn dozens of blocks. Hmm maybe blocks with the most refs...
    - #Conversation 
        - Works for me! Thanks [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]! [*](((shPwbVEW0)))
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Heads up I messed up a little when setting up the [[Projects/Establish automated graph backups]]. Apparently using macOS to do the backups is expensive (1 run minute costs 10 minutes???). Live and learn! Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
            - A user gets 2000 free run minutes a month and mine are close to running out ðŸ˜¬. Check the repo for an incoming PR to fix this
        - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] I think this is a good impulse, especially since the multiplayer [[Roam Games]] is closing soon [*](((gYGadCTR3)))
            - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] Information overload is right! I'm in the same boat honestly. There's been an incredible amount writing and conventions developed in this graph so far. [*](((FqyiA2fgt)))
            - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] Haha I came to the same conclusion as you were typing a response [*](((tvvL44n95)))

        - #Resources 
            - Interested in [[Mat McGann]]'s work on collaborative Roaming. 
                - He has been running his business in Roam, with his team â€” as a collaborative graph. 
                - He published a database explaining these practices. More on that [here](https://twitter.com/matmcgann/status/1358416938129453062?s=21).
                - Here is the link to that [graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/multiplayerknowledgebases/page/tIRpxfXyY). It's impressive.
                - {{[[TODO]]}} Review Mat's graph for lessons that can apply to Roam Collective.  #[[Help Wanted]]
        - #Q How do you confront feelings of [[chaos]] and overwhelm? 
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Find the biggest rock you can lift, and carry it. #responsibility
                - #Q How does this apply to Roam Collective?
                    - Convergence and finding a sense of order is everyone's collective responsibility.
                    - If things feel chaotic, find something you can [[clarify]] and bring into [[order]].
                    - Ask:
                        - What feels unclear? â€” write that down.
                            - Then reflect on how it could be more clear.
                                - What decisions need to be made? 
                                - What material needs to be summarized?
        - #Q Should phases of [[divergence]] and [[convergence]] be at the same time for all graph members? Or should the individual oscillate though those cycles independent of the group?[*]([[[[E:]] cycles of divergence and convergence]]) #order #chaos
            - Thoughts::
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Freedom of expression is fun.
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Fun drives productivity and engagement.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Individuals have varying thresholds for tolerance of [[chaos]].
                - It is easier to follow the rules when there are less of them.
                - If each individual uses their own intuition as guide for navigating balance, then the whole will benefit. 
                - Global phases of divergence and convergence could be offered, and followed loosely. 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] "[[ride the lightning]]" as a mode of action.
                    - Run with [[inspired action]] as it strikes.
                    - [[non-coercive]] [[productivity]].
                    - #Q What happens when everyone rides the lightning. 
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Roam was built to empower a "[[ride the lightning]]" workflow.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Find order through collective chaos. 
                - As we all ride the lightning, patterns emerge naturally; we improve the surface-area for [[serendipity]]  and [[alignment]].
                - Work independently together, and leverage moments of serendipitous alignment.
                    - Global [[purpose]], [[goals]], and [[vision]] narrows the space that we oscillate around. It creates a lens to think and act through.
                        - Any group action in alignment with the group goals will improve the likelihood of synergy of ideas.
            - A collective graph as a chaotic [[playground]]. 
                - Objective: constrain the chaos through a shared lens.
                    - Like gas within a space, the chaotic energy should fill the space it is given. 
                    - #Q How is chaos tamed?
                        - Conventions, norms, objectives, and methods of gaining spatial awareness.
        - #I I suspect that there is an association between an individual's personality and their propensity to gravitate towards various graph activities and roles.
