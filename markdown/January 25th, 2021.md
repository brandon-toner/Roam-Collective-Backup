    - **The graph is periodically unstable â€” if things look odd, there might be sync stuff going on:** 
        - Missing/misplaced blocks
        - Missing CSS

        - Unable to add blocks in some places
    - Welcome to [[Roam-Collective]]! [Start here]([[Welcome ðŸ˜ƒ]]). 
    - Objectives:: 
        - Create a [[Roam Collaboration Guide]]
        - Create a hub for the [[Roam Games]]
    - Jump right in! [I'll]([[Brandon Toner]]) be moderating so will be able to provide guidance/feedback as you create blocks.
    - Tips:: 
        - Click on any bullet to "zoom in" for a more focused perspective (reducing the noise, and focusing on your section) - this also helps with stability if there are a lot of us writing simultaneously.
        - Check out the #[[Help Wanted]] page references for opportunities to contribute.
        - Check out [[January 25th, 2021]] for some great examples of the conventions in motion.
        - Jump right in! [I'll]([[Brandon Toner]]) be moderating so will be able to provide guidance/feedback as you create blocks.
        - Check out the #[[Fleeting Notes]] linked references for some [[atomic ideas]].
            - Reference them under a #Conversation block within your [[DNP Section]] to add some commentary.
        - Document your ideas in [the collective zettelkasten]([[zettelkasten]]) to improve their longevity and connection to other ideas in the database.
        - [[Create new pages freely, in keeping with the conventions.]] 
            - If making a new [collection]([[collections]]), document within your [[change log]].
    - **Catching up on the action**
        - Check the #[[Change Log]] linked references for a running list of the changes over time.
        - Check the #Announcements linked references for a running list of important memos
        - Explore the block references on the [[Prompts]] page to see community responses to various prompts

    - 22:17 â€” Set goal of creating a [[Roam Collaboration Guide]]
    - 23:16 â€”Â Noticed some [[CSS]] changes (looks good!) Might be helpful to log those changes using the `#[[Change Log]]`, nested under your [[DNP Section]] so that we can track them (who made what change when +/- why).

                - Nest feedback beneath a `#Feedback` tag in your [[DNP Section]].
            11. {{[[TODO]]}} Improve [[roam/css]] styling (make it more consistent and easy on the eyes)
                - Background colour consistency... Dark grey vs light grey â€” what's the distinction?

            13. {{[[TODO]]}} Create some structure around the first [[Roam Games]] challenge [[February 1st, 2021]] 
            14. {{[[DONE]]}} Establish a "[[Daily Activities]]" workflow. #Processes
                - Each day, one is added to the top of the page. Selected by anyone if it's not already there.

            - "Vision:: ((See block references for additional ideas.))"
                - A space that is able to asynchronously host collaboration towards a common goal. 
                - Members of the space adhere to shared conventions that facilitate clear and orderly communication. 
                - It is easy to tell what is going on. 
                - It is easy to contribute.
                - It is accessible to "intermediate users" 
            - Conversation::
                - "Seeding graphs"
                    - How can we effectively "seed" graphs with baseline information?
                        - Depending on features used, JSON or markdown exports should work relatively well for this.
                            - When cross-graph linking comes, it could be as simple has hosting a source graph.
        - #[[Roam Enhancement Requests]]
            - Ability to assign SOME users with global editing privileges
                - Goal: Some can edit ANY block. Some can ONLY edit their own
        - [[chat]] and [[notifications]] #Conventions
            - Originally, I liked this syntax: `[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]` (from [[[[Roam Book Club]] II]]), but I kinda like this one `[[@]]`... 
                - The latter gives you the ability to view ALL UNREADS across the graph. Plus, you can still filter `[[@]]` by your name to find YOUR unreads.

                - Roam Lab
                    - Small focuses coimmunity with a facilitator
                    - Philosophy: independence

                    - Shared workspace
                    - Can partially work on something then drop it â€” artifact exists for others to pick up the baton.
                    - Speaking the same language - shared conventions.
                    - Synchronous still necessary (**for moderation and alignment?**)
                    - Metaframeworks, communicators

                - Seeding graphs
    - #[[The Zettelkasten]]
        1. #[[Fleeting Notes]] [Block references]([[block references]]) are key within a [[collaborative graph]]. Non-intrusive commentary â€” the original context is preserved.
        2. #[[Fleeting Notes]] Strong conventions within a [[collaborative graph]] help to maintain [[order]] and mitigate [[chaos]].
        3. #[[Fleeting Notes]] The biggest hurdle is in ESTABLISHING shared conventions. Once they are set and understood, the system fades, and emphasis directs towards the content.
        4. #[[Questions]] How can we prevent a collaborative graph from feeling overwhelming?
            - Maybe through strong onboarding? Clubhouse calls to address questions? Encouraging the use of the `#Questions` to create dialogue about conventions.
        5. #[[Fleeting Notes]] The Zettelkasten might be the best place for open questions... as they can be blended with assertions and other ideas. Less filing burden ("where does this go?").
        6. #I â€” Might change `#Comments` to `#Commentary`... feels more clear that it's commentary on stuff within the graph. #Conventions
    - #Promptstorming
        1. From the [[Prompts]] page: "What types of products or outcomes could collaborative communities work towards? How might this look?"
            - For book club:
                - Book reading companion
                    - Thinking of something like what [[Sam Marfleet]] made for [[[[R:]] Hero of a Thousand Faces]]...
                - Study guide
        1. "What goals or objectives would you like to work towards with [[Roam-Collective]]? [*](((ODwYwd-L7)))"
            - "To create a [[Roam Collaboration Guide]] that can be used to support multiplayer Roam communities."
        3. From the references on `[[Open Questions]]`: "What is the best method of notifications?"
            - The `@` and `~` convention from [[[[Roam Book Club]] II]] seemed to work well.
            - #[[Q]] Is this only possible if "only edit your blocks" is disabled?
        4. "How to tag ideas related to graph conventions and processes?"
            - Under `[[[[Feedback]]: [[Suggestions]]]]`?
        5. "How important is it to stick to vanilla Roam?"
    - #Conversation
        1. "[[~]][[Brandon Toner]] any blocks you create we can't edit/delete â€” just something to keep in mind (see the duplicate comments and feedback sections below)" â€” fixed
        1. "[[~]] [[Brandon Toner]] how do you feel about using templates? I like these daily note headings â€” I think using either templates or smartblocks could be great to standardize structure..." Love templates, they help to facilitate structure â€”Â started some [here]([[Templates]])
            - Feel free to add some! You could make a `#Templates` section in your DNP section, and create some [[SmartBlocks]] there #Processes #templates
        1. Added [[roam/css]]
            - I copy/pasted from another shared graph so I'm not sure what's there yet haha. Will sift through later.
        2. "**Creating new pages.** All new pages should be ^^LOWERCASE^^, except:"
            - I know this sounds restrictive, but it is really important to compile ideas optimally. 
            - Nothing will "break" if you don't follow this, but it will lead to a bunch of sorta-related page names and some missed connections.
        3. [[Woah]] the new "unread block references" feature is AWESOME!! 
        6. "[[~]] [[Brandon Toner]] Also, think that it could be valuable to build out a tag for relevant references or resources. Ideally these would be ones related to the goals of the graph..."
            - Yup this is a great idea. 
            - Maybe `#Resources`? [[~]][[Charles Farr]]
                - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] This would work. In my personal graph is use block level tags to identify resources and then aggregate them in a central location..."
                    - Yup, this is exactly the workflow I have in mind! 
Community suggests via block-level tagging, then graph editors compile them centrally. 
        7. "Just created my bio page at this point. Still reading through the extensive documentation ðŸ¤£"
            - I just thinned it out a bunch haha
    - #Chat
        - Thoughts on this? [[~]][[Charles Farr]], [[Everyone]]: "Block ref the sections to add your ideas around mission, vision, purpose, goals, etc."
            - Feels like a good way to converge ideas on something. 
            - Note the use of the (()) symbol on [[About [[Roam-Collective]]]]
        - [[~]][[Charles Farr]] â€” Added [[Roam Collaboration Guide]] as a target artifact for this group. My thoughts is that if we can work to collaborate towards a finished product here, we can port the processes into [[Roam Book Club]] and other communities. 
            - My thoughts on process: #Processes
                - Use block references to the table of contents to gather ideas on the content of each section
                - Editors help to compile the content within the references into the contents of each section
                - Synchronous conversation (Clubhouse) and Slack can be used to iron out any points of contention.

    - #[[The Zettelkasten]]
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] The biggest hurdle is in ESTABLISHING shared conventions. Once they are set and understood, the system fades, and emphasis directs towards the content."
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Shared conventions are part of the graph "platform" that enables higher-level tasks â€” building a flexible and lightweight platform allows for innovation and ideally lowers friction for users
    - #Conversation
        - "How important is it to stick to vanilla Roam?"
            - It's my belief that there are too many valuable extensions to not leverage them if they can provide some benefit.
            - However, any extension represents a tradeoff in user-friendliness. Worthwhile to considering adding documentation to support onboarding. 
    - #Feedback
        - [[~]] [[Brandon Toner]] how do you feel about using templates? I like these daily note headings â€” I think using either templates or smartblocks could be great to standardize structure...
        - [[~]] [[Brandon Toner]] Also, think that it could be valuable to build out a tag for relevant references or resources. Ideally these would be ones related to the goals of the graph...
        - [[~]][[Brandon Toner]] any blocks you create we can't edit/delete â€” just something to keep in mind (see the duplicate comments and feedback sections below)
        - "Maybe `#Resources`? [[~]][[Charles Farr]]"
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] This would work. In my personal graph is use block level tags to identify resources and then aggregate them in a central location...
                - For instance `#Ref, #Book, #Article` which would be captured in a query within `#Resources`
                    - An example would be `#Book How To Take Smart Notes`
                - A big question is just when to make something a page versus a block? Page architecture depends on preferences for namespaces versus using nested page references â€” [[e.g.]], `Book/How To Take Smart Notes` vs. `How To Take Smart Notes [Book]`

        - This is actually my first multiplayer graph because I wasn't a part of the book club and so this is all very exciting
        - I __loved__ the onboarding and thought it was a great way to get started and get everything set up
        - Original thoughts are that I like that there is enough structure but also enough flexibility to create your own structure ([[i.e.]] specific [[DNP Modules]] but you can customize your DNP Template to your liking)
        - The one thing that will be important to master is [[conventions]] because I use Roam in a specific way in my personal graph but there needs to be more structure and order in this kind of space so that there isn't a ton of noise
