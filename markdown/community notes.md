- A space to **catch-up on the "highlights"** of the graph!

**Tips:**
- Review past announcements and highlights from the "Main Feed" below.
- Don't worry too much about "staying caught up" â€” there is a lot of activity in the graph. Instead, focus on deciding the areas/projects/products/questions you are interested in following or contributing to. #blk-grey
