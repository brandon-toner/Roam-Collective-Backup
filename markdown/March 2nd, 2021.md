        - #Q Where are we with Sprints/Epics?
            - **Epics:**
                - [[Epics/Establish and document baseline RC conventions and workflows]] Status:: [[Status/Active]]
                    - **Options for "Next":**
                        - Prepare a JSON file as a **"collective graph starter pack"** 
                - [[Epics/Managing knowledge dependencies in multiplayer]] Status:: [[Status/Active]]
                    - **Options for "Next":**
                        - Explore options for automation, making the population of the agora easier and more reliable.
                        - Refine Agora submissions template to further enhance the navigation of dependencies
                - [[Epics/Implement Agile Methodologies in Roam]] Status:: [[Status/Active]]
                    - **Options for "Next":**
                        - Mature the backlog conventions. 
                        - Document the workflow somewhere, as guidance documentation. 
            - **Sprints:**
                - [[Sprints/1 — Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)]] Status:: [[Status/Active]]
                    - Questions::
                        - What work is left to do here?
                        - What are the open questions? 
                        - Are we still eager to work on this actively? Or do we want to move on to something else. 
                - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Sprints/2 — Roam Games 3 (populate the Agora)]] Status:: [[Status/Completed]]
                    - Status adjusted to **completed.** 
            - **Suggestions for "Next":**
                1. Mature the backlog conventions. 
                    - This should be easy -- we're 90% there.
                2. Prepare a JSON file as a **"collective graph starter pack"** 
                    - We have most of the components now -- we likely just need to tidy up some CSS, add some instructions, and form the JSON. 
                        - Will also need to think of how we keep it current.
        - #I I'm thinking [[sprints]] show NOT be named. Just date ranges... with the content of the sprint on the page?
            - "projects" should be listed on the sprint pages as places to focus efforts.
            - #N There should only be **one** active [sprint]([[sprints]]) at a time. 
            - #N [[sprints]] should have a defined time window that is firm / non-negotiable.
                - If project work assigned to a sprint is not completed, it can be included in the next sprint.
            - #N [[sprints]] should be defined by time rather than project content.
                - Example::
                    - Not this: [[Sprints/1 — Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)]] Status:: [[Status/Active]]
                        - This sprint should have been resolved after 1-2 weeks, and a component of managing dependencies be built using a project.
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Review Mark's notes from [[March 1st, 2021]] 
        - #Q How might RC conventions be optimized for the [[Roam Think Tank]]? [*]([[Projects/Develop Shared Graph for Roam Think Tank]])[*]([[@[[Charles Farr]]]])[*]([[@[[Mark Robertson]]]])
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Look into "lazy consensus"
    - #Conversation 
        - [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] 
            - We have a graph - "roaminati"
                - Excellent. As conversation evolves, I'll offer our support for setting up RC conventions to ensure a smooth implementation.
                - I think the "Think Tank" experiment will operate much better within a shared graph. Imagine ~10 daily active writers collaborating in this fashion.
                - Lots of potential here! 
                - Slack is too lossy and too linear for the wide array of topics that will be on the table. 
            - Ugh...Communities. Vote for tech stack preference on slack! 
                - Appears to be leaning Slack...

    - #Inbox
        - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] [re](((u9YdnOIa6))) — my thesis on [[block-level tags]] and generally working and thinking at the [[block-level]] is that doing so is more powerful than working at the page level, because you have direct access to the content.
            - It's a rough theory and I'm interrogating why I believe it. I want to be able to articulate it well, where right now it's really just something that I __feel__.
            - Related::
                - [[cc:[[Joel Chan]]]]'s thread here is using different language but I believe working on a similar thesis...

        - [@Brandon Toner]([[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]) thanks for the [clarification](((FO4DW8gxL))) of where things are with respect to [[agile development]]
            - This is also what I was thinking -> Manually, this could be done based on a `Dependencies::` attribute on the story (project) page. — with the status block reffed on the same line to promote good [visibility](((D3gcKeMVe))) without having to click-in to the project.[*](((4d48_3iGO)))
                - I am thinking once things are more fleshed out something could relatively easily be done with [[roam/render]] and some [[datalog]] queries

            - We are already on [[Discord]] now. 
                - I like Discord [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] — on voice chat with [[Joel Chan]] and [[Roamhacker]] right now.
            - [[@[[Mark Robertson]]]] — [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]] was toying with [this question](((YJczFOqWB))) here, essentially asking how we drive down the [[search costs]] to allow for participation.
        - On Agile
            - Discussed stories with [Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) last week as they relate to epics — and we opted to move towards "projects" as the smaller unit of work as  compared to epics. So stories = **projects** in RC as it currently stands.
                - [[@[[Wade Dominic]]]] [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] the thought here was just that stories felt very product specific, but what we're doing here is a bit amorphous, so we landed on projects.

            - However, these conventions are slow. Instead of an immediate chat, I believe that they are more like writing a letter (snail-mail) or an email. There is great value in this approach, but it does fall short for other types of communication.
            - The value of the graph is that things are **organized** as they are communicated. It bundles those steps -- driving the compounding of ideas across time.
