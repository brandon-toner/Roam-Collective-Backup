        3. **Brandon:** Thoughts on [this](((ROVBmMBrp)))? 
            - Peter: I think I can get by this! Let's try it. You should see author and time by hovering over the dot. I wonder if the time is in your timezone.
            - **Matt V** I like how we can see everyone's conversations here
        4. 🚨 FYI I was talking to an engineer with Roam and he told me that block versions are kind of a hack and can sometimes lead to orphaned blocks

        7. [[Matthew Vogel]]: I've been asked to give a brief roam tour / overview of some of the workflows and conventions that have been emerging on this and other multiplayer graphs to a group of people mostly only familiar with single player graphs.  
 What does #Everyone think are the most important workflows/conventions to touch on? 
            - I'm thinking conventions that are tested and seem to work (even if we are still iterating on them). So far I'm thinking about touching on most of the [[Quick Start Guide]], the `@` chat convention, [[Daily Activities]]/[[Prompts]], and using double parenthesis `(( ))` while writing to search across the graph for adjacent blocks

            - I found an interesting consideration about what you said in a Sci-Fi book I was reading last weekend.
        - Can we map out all of the topics we have discussed over last week in a page and as important notes correction were made things can be ~~struck through~~ or they can converge to a permanent note.
            - I find conversation difficult to follow at times, how so we bring them to a one page view?
        - are there #conventions about how to react to people entries? If I just wanted to upvote a message, validate it or show that I read an `[[everyone]]` message we could just react to the block like I am reacting to this message. 
        - Conventions for Δ?

        - [[Everyone]] do we have weekly and monthly reviews which can be used as structured ways to force convergence? Structured reviews become like habits and take increasingly less time and become frictionless as the systems put in place make them easy to perform [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] ((Shall we have review cycles to force convergence of certain topics so that we don't diverge too much?))
            - e.g. Weekly reviews: https://youtu.be/kNL6mA5kRec
            - "Think it could be interesting to explore - what types of questions / template are you envisioning?"
                - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] we need to make a decision on what information to keep coming back which to archive and possibly which to delete. Or at least we need to have a conversation about what are our objectives. For examples my management system is still in notion, for now, my weekly pages give me an overview of the important things I wrote/noted in daily pages (e.g. did I stick to my habits, how did I sleep, how happy was I?) Having all of that information in one place you can go through them and decide what is to be forgotten and only found when searched, what needs to be archived, or what needs to be dealt with and when. That works well with tasks, but how do we do something similar?
At the end of a week/month, I feel like fleeting notes should be reorganised in a page forming a conversation which might lead the following week to some permanent notes. [[cc[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc[[Charles Farr]]]] 
__I love that your comment came from back in time 🤣!!__

Monthly reviews could include a zoom catchup?
"How could synchronous tools like [[Zoom]] or [[Clubhouse]] be used to support collaboration in a collaborative graph?"
        - [[Everyone]] How do we develop a skill to have divergent and convergent conversations. I think lots of interesting conversation with friends just kept on diverging until nobody remembered why we were discussing what and we just moved on. Not all conversations need to go somewhere, but is there a skill?

    - #[[Scratchpad]]
        - Our [[communication]] mechanism right now, using `@/cc`, is emulating mail system, which is implicitly [[asynchronous]].
        - I personally love mailing, which is a good balance between slow and fast thinking, especially when I’m having question to solve.
        - in-time chat vs mail-based chat is one typical implementation on [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) [[communication]].
        - Actually, is [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) actually a subjective definition?
        - Our current [[communication]] [[conventions]] feels like a mix of in-time chat and mail-based chat.
        - If I consider face-to-face chatting is truly [[synchronous]], compared with other [[communication]] method, then I could think of some differences as shown below ... 
            - enables [[divergence]] easily.
                - Assumption: everyone’s mind is reasonable.
                - Under [this assumption](((5SJKfkOSd))), in the situation that our communication topic jump from one to another, there must a way to reason about such transformation.
                    - the input for the transformation is mostly(?) related to states, which can be outside-world state(e.g. touch, voice, etc.) and/or inner-world state(one’s own thinking)
                    - #[[P:Self]] normally, when we’re in the context of [[communication]], the content of communication itself has high priority in our thought, but when the content isn’t interesting me, its priority decreases and my own thoughts(not much related to current topic, even not related to the whole conversation) floats up and I may suddenly change the topic. And sometimes, other will feels weird.
                    - #[[P:Self]] Sometimes, something clicked in my mind, but it’s off context of the whole communication, and I can’t help saying that thoughts out and other will also feel weird.
                - When we’re talking face-to-face, we share much more states than pure words communication. AND, every shared state is the potential link to another topic, meaning that we have much more broader choices on topics, and therefore, much more possible for a [[divergent]] [[communication]].
                - #[[P:Self]] Sadly speaking, this may be the core reason why I don’t like casual phone call, seems that i don’t have much ‘hooks’ to do fast association with pure voice when the content itself has not much structure(even with my previous girl friend...). Kind of weird, man...

            - [[@[[Zsolt Viczián]]]] has put together several smartblock templates that will run a datalog query and display it in a nice way. It's great work and an exceptionally good article but in my opinion actually pollutes the graph with `:hiccup` blocks. The better way would probably be to use [[roam/render]] custom components. [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] here's another rabbit hole of customization to fall down :P Right now the smartblock solution feels very much like a ["Hacked" solution]([[[[E:]] "Hacked" solutions are likely to break over time.]]) with custom components being more ["native"]([[[[E:]] Use the native convention as much as possible.]])
                - You can get his smartblocks [here](https://zsviczian.github.io/DatomicQuery.zip) but be warned they're very complicated.  Nothing like the simple system you've imagined.
        - [[Feature Request]] I would kill for a way to filter out code blocks from search results
        - {{[[embed]]: ((((0nxSPSAyD))))}}
            - I'm struggling with this on my personal graph as well. There needs to be a stronger connection between root level color options and where those colors are actually used
                - "🚨 FYI I was talking to an engineer with Roam and he told me that block versions are kind of a hack and can sometimes lead to orphaned blocks"
    - #Questions ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) 
        - How do you #query? for blocks that contain 2 tags and not for when one is a child of the other
            - i.e. look for this 
                - #tag1 #tag2
            - Not this
                - #tag1
                    - #tag2
    - #Conversation 
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] Short answer, no. Namespaces aren't expressed in CSS, they're interpreted by Roam's internal parser. The only way I know of changing the namespace is through user prefs.[*](((uAKl3yKFe)))
            - I uses namespaces extensively in my personal graph since I know they'll be useful in the future but at this moment in Roam they're cosmetic. You can't query for them without #datalog . Right now it feels like page references in the page name work alright but I often end up duplicating the page reference under a [[Tags]] attribute so who knows lol 
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] what benefit do you see for filtering a page using [[OR]] instead of constructing a regular #query ? 
`{{[[query]]: {or: [[ex-B]] [[ex-C]]}}}`
            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] have you tried the [query builder](((OIrYB9b3N))) script? You're right, it's still not as simple as a page filter but it brings the complexity of creating a query WAY down [*](((j2oZoVpHO)))
        - [[@[[Peter Rosso]]]] [*](((zM6l437S8))) Yes there is! [Check it out.](((hupwRjd9n))) This should follow each page even if the order is changed. I tried to keep the color subtle so it's not too aggressive [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]]
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] did some more tweaking of CSS, interested in your thoughts. We may be getting into overload territory with to many tweaks from vanilla for new users [*](((uiP-kSPjh)))
    - #[[Change Log]]
        - [Added CSS](((dQZ2rE2un))) to prevent the right sidebar page title from jumping around when editing the title

        - I'm loving the energy and iteration on this graph but I am a little concerned about how many features and conventions we want to add before they become more of a hindrance than a help to new graph users.
            - The more separate and different conventions we have for chat (just for example) the more likely they are going to be misused
