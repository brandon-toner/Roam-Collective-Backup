        1. **Peter:** "[[Everyone]] Would people want to add birthdays to their profiles?"
            1. I've added mine - Brandon (page ref to 2021 to generate the reference)
            2. Added mine - Peter
        2. **Peter:** "[[Everyone]] do we have weekly and monthly reviews which can be used as structured ways to force convergence? Structured reviews become like habits and take increasingly less time and become frictionless as the systems put in place make them easy to perform [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] ((Shall we have review cycles to force convergence of certain topics so that we don't diverge too much?))"
        3. **Brandon:** Thoughts on [this](((ROVBmMBrp)))? 
            - Peter: I think I can get by this! Let's try it. You should see author and time by hovering over the dot. I wonder if the time is in your timezone.
            - **Matt V** I like how we can see everyone's conversations here
            - **Larissa** I like this!
            - Charles Farr:: 10/10 would chat again
            - **leekeifon:** Just wanna point out the key feature of this implementation, that‚Äôs in-time chatting and of course, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs necessary to forward the communication the future or just let it set at that day.
            - **leekeifon:** But it should be the nice start for synchronous communication, all the contents will be in the air, just like face-to-face talk. You could get your notes down if you want to, but no one is forced to do so.
            - :And actually, I don‚Äôt think
        4. **Matt V:** üö® FYI I was talking to an engineer with Roam and he told me that block versions are kind of a hack and can sometimes lead to orphaned blocks
            - Like what we are using for CSS? - Brandon
                - **Matt V**: Yes
            - Charles Farr:: This makes sense ‚Äî you can actually still block reference from a version even if it's not selected. I bet all it does is "hide" the other versions in some way.
                - For CSS shouldn't be too much of a problem though...
                - **Matt V** Yea that's what's going on and part of the issues is that, currently, the hidden options aren't assigned a parent block so can become detached very easily 
        5. **Brandon:** Why the blue text on *some* shortcuts in the sidebar?
            - Image:: 
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2Fj0rnFxGw2k.png?alt=media&token=7b9dba9e-f7ff-486f-b59d-8e57df402e66)
            - **Matt V:** was an idea of [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]], detailed [here](((To3tG6XRj)))
            - **Peter:** I thought it would attract attentions of new members. Personally I'd click on the big read button if nobody stopped me. Especially if it says welcome and has a smiley face...
            - **Brandon:** Love it! Moved them around a bit, and adjusted the color a tad ‚Äî really like it. Definitely more attractive for click-through.
        6. **Brandon:** For the top-section chat, let's think up some conventions/norms ((Block ref into your section, as these might get elaborate!))
        7. **Matt V:** I've been asked to give a brief roam tour / overview of some of the workflows and conventions that have been emerging on this and other multiplayer graphs to a group of people mostly only familiar with single player graphs.  
 What does #Everyone think are the most important workflows/conventions to touch on? [*]([[Matthew Vogel]])
            - I'm thinking conventions that are tested and seem to work (even if we are still iterating on them). So far I'm thinking about touching on most of the [[Quick Start Guide]], the `@` chat convention, [[Daily Activities]]/[[Prompts]], and using double parenthesis `(( ))` while writing to search across the graph for adjacent blocks
            - **Peter:** I'd have suggested pretty much what you listened.  The difference between `Chat` and `Conversation` is tackled [here](((ROVBmMBrp)))
        8. **Peter:** roamcollective.org is $10 per year üëÄ Output channell?
            - **Brandon:** Ou! Cool idea. Totally. How do we get it set up? [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]]
            - Charles Farr:: I think this is a great idea ‚Äî I've got a $1 I'm willing to chip in lol
        9. **Brandon:** "Doubting the usefulness of the #Everyone tag... thoughts?"
            - **Larissa** I like leekeifon's idea of having some tag that triggers a vote/action, imagine that's a similar motivation to an Everyone tag, but doesn't seem like the `#Everyone` is the right implementation
        10. **Brandon:** Where in the CSS does the query appearance get adjusted? (Not seeing anything references in the change log)
            - Image::
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FpYoCDth_sJ.png?alt=media&token=0ce5b39b-bd4f-4cbe-bc1a-f706479be55b)
            - **Matt V:** Honestly it doesn't look like any of the [query css](((KOuJf-Smr))) is doing anything...
            - Charles Farr:: You're got to add a tag to the same block as a query ‚Äî `#minimal`, `#min-con`, `#min-title`, etc. (check the css for the IDs in the block tags)

        - "Go thought yesterdays Scratchpad before opening any Pandora's Box."
            - PPV keeps a meaningful and directed approach which avoids getting lost in too many tasks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0GrpGA0o2k&ab_channel=AugustBradley

        - '`[[@[[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]]`'"[[^[[Peter Rosso]]]] the below block is an attempt to explain what I had in mind, a bit out there, more like several steps further down the line from agreeing on what's a brick :) "
            - I found an interesting consideration about what you said in a Sci-Fi book I was reading last weekend.
        - Can we map out all of the topics we have discussed over last week in a page and as important notes correction were made things can be ~~struck through~~ or they can converge to a permanent note.
            - I find conversation difficult to follow at times, how so we bring them to a one page view?
        - are there #conventions about how to react to people entries? If I just wanted to upvote a message, validate it or show that I read an `[[everyone]]` message we could just react to the block like I am reacting to this message. 
        - Conventions for Œî?

        - Check out "#Scratchpad ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))"
        - Go thought yesterdays Scratchpad before opening any Pandora's Box.
    - #Conversation 
        - [[Everyone]] do we have weekly and monthly reviews which can be used as structured ways to force convergence? Structured reviews become like habits and take increasingly less time and become frictionless as the systems put in place make them easy to perform [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] ((Shall we have review cycles to force convergence of certain topics so that we don't diverge too much?))
            - e.g. Weekly reviews: https://youtu.be/kNL6mA5kRec
            - "Think it could be interesting to explore - what types of questions / template are you envisioning?"
                - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] we need to make a decision on what information to keep coming back which to archive and possibly which to delete. Or at least we need to have a conversation about what are our objectives. For examples my management system is still in notion, for now, my weekly pages give me an overview of the important things I wrote/noted in daily pages (e.g. did I stick to my habits, how did I sleep, how happy was I?) Having all of that information in one place you can go through them and decide what is to be forgotten and only found when searched, what needs to be archived, or what needs to be dealt with and when. That works well with tasks, but how do we do something similar?
At the end of a week/month, I feel like fleeting notes should be reorganised in a page forming a conversation which might lead the following week to some permanent notes. [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] 
__I love that your comment came from back in time ü§£!!__

Monthly reviews could include a zoom catchup?
"How could synchronous tools like [[Zoom]] or [[Clubhouse]] be used to support collaboration in a collaborative graph?"
        - [[Everyone]] How do we develop a skill to have divergent and convergent conversations. I think lots of interesting conversation with friends just kept on diverging until nobody remembered why we were discussing what and we just moved on. Not all conversations need to go somewhere, but is there a skill?
        - [[~[[leekeifon]]]] What does [reasonable](((5SJKfkOSd))) mean?
        - [[Everyone]] Would people want to add birthdays to their profiles?
        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] [*](((To3tG6XRj))) You are a wizard!!  
            - üôè
        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]], is there a way to get a preview of the page when hovering over a connection that does not use a hashtag like when hovering above a connection a link, i.e. can we get a page preview like the one you get on the evergreen notes website? 
            - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] Yes but only if you're running roam42. It's called [[Live Preview]] and you'll need to enable it yourself
                - "Use `CTRL+Hover` to preview a page or a block reference using [[Roam42]] [[Live Preview]]"

        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] The [drop-down menus](((uRYMznUlI))) could be used to indicate the maturity of an `Evergreen Note`... Do they work with links to pages? e.g.

    - #[[Scratchpad]]
        - Our [[communication]] mechanism right now, using `@/cc`, is emulating mail system, which is implicitly [[asynchronous]].
        - I personally love mailing, which is a good balance between slow and fast thinking, especially when I‚Äôm having question to solve.
        - in-time chat vs mail-based chat is one typical implementation on [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) [[communication]].
        - Actually, is [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) actually a subjective definition?
        - Our current [[communication]] [[conventions]] feels like a mix of in-time chat and mail-based chat.
        - If I consider face-to-face chatting is truly [[synchronous]], compared with other [[communication]] method, then I could think of some differences as shown below ... 
            - enables [[divergence]] easily.
                - Assumption: everyone‚Äôs mind is reasonable.
                - Under [this assumption](((5SJKfkOSd))), in the situation that our communication topic jump from one to another, there must a way to reason about such transformation.
                    - the input for the transformation is mostly(?) related to states, which can be outside-world state(e.g. touch, voice, etc.) and/or inner-world state(one‚Äôs own thinking)
                    - #[[P:Self]] normally, when we‚Äôre in the context of [[communication]], the content of communication itself has high priority in our thought, but when the content isn‚Äôt interesting me, its priority decreases and my own thoughts(not much related to current topic, even not related to the whole conversation) floats up and I may suddenly change the topic. And sometimes, other will feels weird.
                    - #[[P:Self]] Sometimes, something clicked in my mind, but it‚Äôs off context of the whole communication, and I can‚Äôt help saying that thoughts out and other will also feel weird.
                - When we‚Äôre talking face-to-face, we share much more states than pure words communication. AND, every shared state is the potential link to another topic, meaning that we have much more broader choices on topics, and therefore, much more possible for a [[divergent]] [[communication]].
                - #[[P:Self]] Sadly speaking, this may be the core reason why I don‚Äôt like casual phone call, seems that i don‚Äôt have much ‚Äòhooks‚Äô to do fast association with pure voice when the content itself has not much structure(even with my previous girl friend...). Kind of weird, man...
        - #[[Q]] It should be possible to differentiate [these structure](((fQ5H_Edl8))) by [[datalog]] query. But I would like a discussion on the semantics of these structures. In other words, **why we want to distinguish these two types of structure when we‚Äôre writing**? It has certain [[patterns]] to be recognized.  [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
            - Related:: sibling query feature request mentioned by [[Joel Chan]] and [[Robert Haisfield]] in their chatting video.
            - Related:: The above block is the example of "#[[FN]] block-embed [[model]]"
        - Actually, tooltip is a great entry point for conveying [[conventions]] on "#[[FN]] block-level [[model]]" and "#[[FN]] block-embed [[model]]".
        - #[[Q]] What‚Äôs the best way to convey information within a block?
            - Observations:: one [[tensions]] is, when the linking intention and the center of block information don‚Äôt align.
            - #[[FN]] Those css that are not trying to convey the center of block information, tends to dull our concentration.
                - {{[[TODO]]}} Examples:: convey what I think is good and what‚Äôs not.
        - "Assumption: everyone‚Äôs mind is reasonable."
            - concretely speaking, there should be a logical chain behind what we said, implicitly or explicitly. And we may be able to trace along the logical chain   and that‚Äôs what I mean ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô.
        - #[[I]] Technically speaking, I think it‚Äôs possible to write a `roam/js` plugin ((not rely on browser setting)) for community members to render their own private style. Am I wrong? [[cc:[[Matthew Vogel]]]] [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
        - Play around with datalog

    	[?e :block/string ?str]
		[(re-matches #".*Community Note.*" ?str)]	  
	]
        - #[[Experiments]] discover pattern on indentation.
    - #[[Conversation]]
        - (re:) "Doubting the usefulness of the #Everyone tag... thoughts?" [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]]
            - Different from announcement, which is controlled in [your]([[Brandon Toner]]) hand, `#Everyone` tag can be used by other community memebers.
            - Seems that we have no way to ignore it automatically(i.e. by query) after we read the message with `Everyone` tag, not like current communication mechanism.
            - One way to think of it, is to consider it as a [Roam collective personal publish protocol](((Mfh93O_VB))), that gives each community member the power to establish their own channel.
        - (re:) "concretely speaking, there should be a logical chain behind what we said, implicitly or explicitly. And we may be able to trace along the logical chain   and that‚Äôs what I mean ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô." reply on [this](((ggbIr98bW))) [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]]

            - [[@[[Zsolt Viczi√°n]]]] has put together several smartblock templates that will run a datalog query and display it in a nice way. It's great work and an exceptionally good article but in my opinion actually pollutes the graph with `:hiccup` blocks. The better way would probably be to use [[roam/render]] custom components. [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] here's another rabbit hole of customization to fall down :P Right now the smartblock solution feels very much like a ["Hacked" solution]([[Evergreens/"Hacked" solutions are likely to break over time.]]) with custom components being more ["native"]([[Evergreens/Use the native convention as much as possible.]])

                - #tag1 #tag2
            - Not this
                - #tag1
                    - #tag2
    - #Conversation 
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Short answer, no. Namespaces aren't expressed in CSS, they're interpreted by Roam's internal parser. The only way I know of changing the namespace is through user prefs.[*](((uAKl3yKFe)))
            - I uses namespaces extensively in my personal graph since I know they'll be useful in the future but at this moment in Roam they're cosmetic. You can't query for them without #datalog . Right now it feels like page references in the page name work alright but I often end up duplicating the page reference under a [[Tags]] attribute so who knows lol 
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] what benefit do you see for filtering a page using [[OR]] instead of constructing a regular #query ? 
`{{[[query]]: {or: [[ex-B]] [[ex-C]]}}}`
            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] have you tried the [query builder](((OIrYB9b3N))) script? You're right, it's still not as simple as a page filter but it brings the complexity of creating a query WAY down [*](((j2oZoVpHO)))
        - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] [*](((zM6l437S8))) Yes there is! [Check it out.](((hupwRjd9n))) This should follow each page even if the order is changed. I tried to keep the color subtle so it's not too aggressive [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]]
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] did some more tweaking of CSS, interested in your thoughts. We may be getting into overload territory with to many tweaks from vanilla for new users [*](((uiP-kSPjh)))
    - #[[Change Log]]
        - [Added CSS](((dQZ2rE2un))) to prevent the right sidebar page title from jumping around when editing the title
        - [Added left sidebar CSS](((hupwRjd9n))) to highlight important pages [*](((zM6l437S8)))
        - [Boosted the visibility of the main page multibar to prevent accidental clicks](((qmCSlYDo9)))
    - #Feedback
        - I'm loving the energy and iteration on this graph but I am a little concerned about how many features and conventions we want to add before they become more of a hindrance than a help to new graph users.
            - The more separate and different conventions we have for chat (just for example) the more likely they are going to be misused

    - #Scratchpad
        - If you click into the MDN level you can `ctrl c ctrl m` and advance through everyone's notes ‚Äî good way to read through the graph...
        - Still trying to wrap my head around the codifying [[maturity]] and [[progression]] of notes (and all other written artifacts) ‚Äî need to #[[Follow Up]] [here](((JifHTbhQh)))

        - On Weekly Reviews with PRosso
            - [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] I like this [idea](((nZArzolvZ))) ‚Äî [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] had started to concatenate a but of questions together. Maybe worthwhile to create a grouped list of all of the scratchpad and conversation topics from the past week.
                - Let's get started on this here: [[Weekly Review: Graph Seed ‚Äî February 4, 2020]]
                    - Will #[[Follow Up]] here tomorrow and start working on it a bit...
                - Also, l love the idea of making it a [[synchronous]] activity ‚Äî let's all hop on Zoom or Clubhouse soon.
        - On Broadcasting to the Graph/Group
            - Regarding the idea of an [Everyone](((yT8htOsew))) tag, I think there's an important function of [[broadcasting]] to the entire community that we need to consider ‚Äî cc: [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[@[[leekeifon]]]] [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]] [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
                - What about some flag `#Broadcast / #Radio / #Vote` that when combined with a date will automatically get populated to a top-level section?
                    - Essentially we would just write a SmartBlock that would surface all blocks with a combination of  `#Broadcast / #Radio / #Vote` + a `DNP: [[February 4th, 2021]]` tag
                        - We would need to add some status flags ‚Äî i.e., `#Settled / #Accepted / #Rejected` to signify that the SmartBlock can drop it
                - Proposed Function (draft)
                    - `#42SmartBlock` Community Input
                        - <%BLOCKMENTIONSDATED:10,Radio,<%DATE:7 days ago%>,<%DATE:in 7 days%>,-Accepted,-Rejected,-Settled%>
        - On statuses of maturity
        - Lightweight Replies
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I started using an attribute ‚Äî I hope I don't come to [regret](((xaNyqoEJT))) it lol
            - [[~[[leekeifon]]]] I agree ‚Äî love a [good email](((Ay1XRIeu-))) conversation!
                - I want to set up an urbit community that automatically exports the daily IRC chat to the graph...
            - [[~[[leekeifon]]]] re: the display [here](((BrDNimG4F))), are you referring the the preview on hover?
            - [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] oof I know the feeling! [Good luck](((tKYIYdWGq)))!
