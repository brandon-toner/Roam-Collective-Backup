                        - My justification is that Andy's notes are [[atomic]]. If they were complex notes, containing multiple ideas, I would consider them articles, and use the reference notes template to interact with their contents.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] many interpretations of [[zettelkasten]] are too strict and rigid. 
                    - [[Andy's Notes]] serve as a great example of a system that has clear standards and conventions, but will consciously [colour outside the lines]([[It is ok to colour outside of the lines.]]) when it [makes sense](((HuYfatW7v))).

                        - Love [this](((pNHeT0VNp))) convention... I'm gonna adopt.
I'd also add a `.` before the `rcDNP` to `.rcDNP` to benefit in [[sorting]]. (__In common ones__)

        - "The UI/UX for such things will get complicated quickly. So having a variety of global navigation blocks or similar might be useful here [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]. You could also see an example, though not really for this exactly, here [➡️](((lRBaD3yYL)))"
            - Yea, agreed. As far as "following" goes, I'd like to keep it simple for now, and encourage others to envision how this might look logistically. 
            - My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [[passive]] or "[[just-in-time]]" [[resurfacing]] 
        - #how-should-I-tag-this #Tensions
            - [[active vs passive resurfacing]]
                - Is this an [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]])? Maybe. It's more a chapter title.
                    - Less of an [assertion]([[assertions]]), but it is a concept that I refer to periodically. 
                    - **I'm going to call it an EN**... because it's UTILITY feels similar/the same. 
        - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I would like to add the [query builder script](https://roamjs.com/docs/extensions/query-builder) to the graph"
            - Fire away! [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]] 🚀, just document in the Change Log within your section (added one for you)
        - "Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention. Honestly not that big of a deal frankly. Just an observation [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - Yea, I think we'll go with nesting as standard convention for now. My strategy for navigating is to Shift-click to open the reference in the side bar, giving me easier access to the [[breadcrumbs]]. [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] 
                - Definitely open to re-evaluating this over time. 
        - "I would have to say that all I would say at this moment is to allow ourselves to find the path, document the justifications/reasons for sticking with and convention and allowing others to see the justification. Though I believe you are already doing this. So let's just do it. [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - Yup, I plan to continue to leave lots of documentation/justification, thinking out loud.
            - Loving your commentary of the conventions, this type of dialogue is the path forward. 
        - "Separately, but related. How can we `@everyone` if we have the gall to do so? [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - Thought a bit about this [here](((iUKkXeJbA)))
                - Barrier to this approach is [notification management](((Ae1spW6Uo)))
            - Better solution I think is [top-section Chat](((ZlhKC6b2i))). [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]]
        - "Another item to consider is that long discussions (with this convention) will indent very quickly, potentially leaving little to no room for readability as we move closer to the right margin. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]. Again, organic development is probably best here, and remain flexible. "
            - My current conceptualization is to return to the level beneath the comments tag with each reply — like in this message.
            - It does get hard to re-trace for someone not a part of the original conversation, though. You'd have to go through the block refs. Which mayyyy not be too bad.
            - I agree with "Again, organic development is probably best here, and remain flexible. " [*](((H0r4ht151)))
        - "You may want to distinguish these two concepts a little bit deep first. And the distinctions themselves will become [[assertions]]."
            - Yup, I agree. I think the drilling down could be conducted on the [[active vs passive resurfacing]] page itself. With more elaboration, and reference to some specific claims. [[~[[leekeifon]]]]
            - Drawing some justification from this part of [[Andy's Notes]]:
                - "I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around). Examples: [Executable strategy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z53fk5XwrsnueNDDCq6WNe2VbPhrDGQmmVgNS), [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3KASfpz5AmNmqM2m517Jbs1EvXrLN7NkeYWH), [Enabling environment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3DaBP4vN1dutjUgrk3jbEeNxScccvDCxDgXe)"
                - I would consider [[active vs passive resurfacing]] related to "nouns and noun-phrases"... an anchor page for more related notes to reference to.
        - [[~[[leekeifon]]]] You're playing with some fascinating ideas! Love it. 
            - How does [global public feed](((cnygMuVlk))) compare to the [[The Main Feed]].
            - What do you see [official events](((yuqfEynX8))) as looking like? Synchronous calls like with [[Roam Book Club]]?
            - Would love to see you mature some of these ideas as [[fleeting notes]]. I bet they would blend well within the [[zettelkasten]]. [[~[[leekeifon]]]]
                - Particularly, [public vs private](((j50xmn4aN))) and any other ideas you'd like to crystalize into something atomic.
                - Happy to support if you have questions about how.
            - How might a [[reputation system]][*](((AClEvNz7Q))) be facilitated in a collaborative graph? I plan to do this somewhat manually with [[Roles]], but I'm not sure the best approaches yet. 
            - Interested to hear more about logic and [[truth]]-seeking. [*](((H6M1XTGet)))
            - Could you elaborate on [this](((iMm8lcvmd)))? [[~[[leekeifon]]]]
                - I think this may relate to the formation of [[evergreen notes]]. Yes?
            - "Good css is not enough, good application is a better way to embed the [[conventions]] that we suggested, take this idea as an [example](((UDqsAeKJg)))."
                - [This](((UDqsAeKJg))) chat plugin idea is cool too! 
            - In general, I think the #Ideas and #Vision tags may be helpful to promote [[resurfacing]] of these ideas through time. 
        - [[Conventions]] to make [these](((HjC43lt9e))) work:
            - Append TODOs with a day or week tag to schedule them. ((Must be in the SAME BLOCK))
            - Append `#[[Flagged]]` to appear in the Flagged report.
            - Update the [week & month variables](((bFUOGEPXz))) weekly and monthly.
            - Test Tasks
        - "So, in fact, I wanna level up the concept "#[[Fleeting Notes]] Roam {X} protocol" to be a page in [[Roam-Collective]]. "
            - [[~[[leekeifon]]]] [[Create new pages freely, in keeping with the conventions.]]
                - "maybe the verb `level up`, can be served as a trigger asking Roamans to vote for the decision?"
                    - Another option is using the [[choice algorithm]]
        - "Yeah, they’re pretty good [[resurfacing]] mechanism, but they seems to be too **public**, and I’m always afraid that my non-mature thoughts will affect others information feed, and this is also one of the reason I care about public vs private."
            - Most of my meanderings are non-mature thoughts. IMO, as long as ideas are traceable and in keeping with the important conventions, their degree of [[certainty]] or [[maturity]] is less important. 
                - They can always be qualified or contended with. 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] When ideas are in public, even disagreement with them can prompt new ideas. 
        - "for a block that’s not yet been level-up to a page" [*](((Fvi-lhrAe)))[*](((67MsLIbX6))) [[cc:[[leekeifon]]]]
            - The [[fleeting notes]] convention is a great way to promote ideas in a time-protected way, without levelling them up to page status.
                - My [[threshold]] for documenting a [fleeting note]([[fleeting notes]]) is far lower than my threshold for documenting an [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]])
                - Example::
                    - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] treat page as [[truth]]. - [[leekeifon]][*](((67MsLIbX6)))"
                        - This, actually feels like it could be an [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]]). Especially since it is an idea that you frequently reference.
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] objective [[truth]] is a high [[standard]].
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] perceived [[truth]] is dependant on [[axiomatic presuppositions]]. 
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[felt [[truth]]]] and [[objective [[truth]]]] are different things. 
                        - Felt truth = "small "t" truth"
                        - Objective truth = "capital "t" truth"
                    - Based on the [high bar of objective truth](((Bv1dMQIvH))), the [reliance on unconscious presuppositions](((ZTimVeKp6))), and the [existence of a "felt" truth as a reasonable alternative](((BrnMMHZ5O))), I would determine it appropriate to level an idea up to [page status (EN)]([[evergreen notes]]) based on [[felt [[truth]]]].[*](((ZZWmGCw0B))) [[cc:[[leekeifon]]]] [*]([[Bookmarks]])[*]([[page naming]])[*]([[zettelkasten]])
        - "From a pure visual(css)’s perspective, is it a good idea to add another tag like `#.Fleeting Notes`, so that I could hide the the word content `Fleeting Notes`?  [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - I'm not sure I understand yet — could you elaborate? [[@[[leekeifon]]]]
        - #[[Graph Mentorship]]
            - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] public vs private "
                - While making a [fleeting note]([[fleeting notes]]), it try to make sure that the note is self-sufficient in communicating its meaning. 
                - In this example I might elaborate the note content a bit to make the idea more clear — and may nest some supportive information underneath. [[@[[leekeifon]]]]

    - #[[Scratchpad]]
        - The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [[Mark Robertson]] really show us the limitless possibility that what [[Roam]] UI can achieve. In other words, we might set our mind free first before we’re trying to implement the UI system in [[Roam]].
        - Maybe we could [[model]] our [[Roam]] [[collaboration]] system with game design mindset, like a RPG game?
            - **Global public feed** that’s official way that help showing new comer what’s current trend(daily/weekly/monthly) in community.
                - It can be [[model]]ed as official newsletter.
                - It can be [[model]]ed as real time notification to Roamans.
                - maybe it becomes a work for a recommendation system, I don’t know if it’s good or not.
            - **Roaman media feed** that’s hold by an individual/a group of Roaman.
                - It’s the free choice for a Roaman decide whether or not subscribing this feed, and the content on the feed is determined by the Roaman/group of Roaman.
            - **Private communication**, should be easy to create and easy to delete.
                - Maybe it’s not necessarily to delete private messages actually, we could **just make it hard to find**, or hides behind the auto-complete list, but that maybe a job for [[Roam]] team. For us, in order to create such a space, we may insert some encoded content into [[Roam]] block which is hard to become a auto-complete candidates and then decoded it via the chatting plugin.
            - **Official event** maybe included topics that we(the whole community) want to focus on, which may need a good voting mechanism.
        - [Global public feed](((_TioVNn4W))) and [Roaman media feed](((FGNR8b-M7))) should obey [Roam publish protocol](((Mfh93O_VB))), [[i.e.]] with a `#publish` tag or some more meta-data.
        - **“Public vs Private”** is one **dimension** to address the **‘space’** concept.
            - Related:: "Thanks for [your reply](((n_PNVqwuw))).

            - Related:: {{[[embed]]: ((((kFPq1Gc9U))))}}
        - One reward for Roaman with high reputation in "Roam reputation system" may be the permission to create new page? If we view [[Roam]] page as a kind of resource.
        - Maybe, we could view page as [[truth]], in one [[Roam]] database, one [[Roam]] community, where these [[truth]] are built on axioms and logical inference, and [[communication]] mechanism is a basic foundation to support the emergence of logical inferences.
        - [Viewing page as truth](((H6M1XTGet))) is a concrete [[goals]] to make our [[communication]] [[converge]].
            - Example:: I think the following chat reveals the short process how I [[converge]] the [[communication]]. I set adding page as my goal and I tend to discuss the meaning, reason and benefit of it.

        - "I decided to consider [this idea]([[active vs passive resurfacing]]) an evergreen note. I think it makes sense, but it challenges my idea that "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[fleeting notes]] and [[evergreen notes]] should be [[assertions]]. #zettelkasten" 

Thoughts? - [[Brandon Toner]]"
            - You may want to distinguish these two concepts a little bit deep first. And the distinctions themselves will become [[assertions]].
                - **Effec**t: By breaking them into smaller distinctions, we may get a more clear sense on how you define these terms.
        - reply to "[[~[[leekeifon]]]] You're playing with some fascinating ideas! Love it. "
            - "How does [global public feed](((cnygMuVlk))) compare to the [[The Main Feed]]."
                - These two concepts should have almost the same meaning. Maybe the key point should be another concept that I mentioned when I talk about global public feed, that’s **Roam publish protocol**.
                    - The Roam publish protocol is good, for the following reasons...
                        - it can automate the **in time update property** of a feed through query mechanism, without needing Roamans jumping back and forth to publish their ideas.
                        - It introduce the idea **protocol**, which is itself a mature and basic concept in the computer network communication. We could dig out more ideas on [[communication]] through this ‘window’.
                - Another small difference is that they use different words, sounds weird... But the key word here is **public**. I wanna highlight the idea of public and private as mentioned [here](((j50xmn4aN))).
                - So, in fact, I wanna level up the concept "#[[Fleeting Notes]] Roam {X} protocol" to be a page in [[Roam-Collective]]. 
                    - But as I mentioned [here](((67MsLIbX6))), page as a resource in database, they should be voted before really adding them into the database. So, I would like to discuss more with the whole community, before we deprecate this idea or level it up or just let it sitting there till it’s mature to become a page or being replaced with better language.
                    - maybe the verb `level up`, can be served as a trigger asking Roamans to vote for the decision?
            - "What do you see [official events](((yuqfEynX8))) as looking like? Synchronous calls like with [[Roam Book Club]]?"
                - Both synchronous and async one is good. For now, I’m kind of lacking visions on how online events can be within [[Roam]]. Some ideas maybe worth digging into.
                    - Emotion/story sharing event? maybe.
                    - web articles/twitter thread sharing, rather than a book, which has shorter feedback loop.
                        - Example:: Jamming about notes on [[Andy Matuschak]]
                - I mean, could we fulfill our online social need purely in [[Roam]], through different events, instead of merely doing knowledge synthesis? #[[Ideas]]
            - "In general, I think the #Ideas and #Vision tags may be helpful to promote [[resurfacing]] of these ideas through time. "
                - Yeah, they’re pretty good [[resurfacing]] mechanism, but they seems to be too **public**, and I’m always afraid that my non-mature thoughts will affect others information feed, and this is also one of the reason I care about public vs private.
            - OK well, about the idea public vs private, I just come up with another idea, which is used in my own database, that’s adding a tag like `#.concept` for a block that’s not yet been level-up to a page, but it could help the Roaman to get a better search for their own words in auto-completion list. A rather balancing way to control the complexity of a database.
            - "How might a [[reputation system]][*](((AClEvNz7Q))) be facilitated in a collaborative graph? I plan to do this somewhat manually with [[Roles]], but I'm not sure the best approaches yet. "
                - [[Roles]] is important, but you know, when the community grows up, the new comer won’t be able to get their ‘specific’ role.
                    - But maybe, they can create their own role by creating new personal feed or new events.
                - Broadly speaking, the [[reputation system]] would have some property like economic system, and maybe Mridula would have some brilliant thoughts on it, I guess.
                - One of my basic assumption is that, treat page as [[truth]], and if the community’s goal is to seeking more [[truth]], then those contributing more [[truth]], should get more reputation. And logical chain along side the prove would gain reputation again. In other words, the more basic arguments and concept, the more importance and reputation it will gain.
                    - Of course, this metric may be too dull, we may need more roads to help Roamans to get their reputation. 
                        - Example:: Seems that reputation system in stackoverflow works well for a long time. They ask by paying reputation and answer to get reputation.
                - And this is [one main reason](((67MsLIbX6))) why I restrict myself adding new pages.
        - From a pure visual(css)’s perspective, is it a good idea to add another tag like `#.Fleeting Notes`, so that I could hide the the word content `Fleeting Notes`?  [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]
        - I may tend reframe the definition of [[felt [[truth]]]] and [[objective [[truth]]]] in my own way by talking about properties they will preserve. [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]
            - [[felt [[truth]]]] is hypothesis.
                - agree with current setting: "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[fleeting notes]] and [[evergreen notes]] should be [[assertions]]. #zettelkasten"
            - [[felt [[truth]]]] can be created by community members freely.
            - [[felt [[truth]]]] will not be deleted, but it could be deprecated.
            - [[objective [[truth]]]] may not be truth in real world.
            - [[objective [[truth]]]] is a result from [[axiomatic presuppositions]] and logical inference.
            - [[axiomatic presuppositions]] is itself [[objective [[truth]]]] within that database.
            - [[axiomatic presuppositions]] can be achieved by consensus of the community.
                - Example:: We (may) all agree that logical inference is the methodology on achieving [[objective [[truth]]]], so we set it as [[axiomatic presuppositions]].
                - Example:: conclusions based on [[Experiments]] result can be candidates for us to achieve consensus.
        - Triggered by [this note](((3F1bAiJBO))), I suggest a set of tags that I learn from [[Andy Matuschak]]’s [[How to write good prompts]], which encodes some patterns on how we understand a concept. In other words, this set of tags should be able to serve as a "#[[Fleeting Notes]] Roam {X} protocol" when communicating concept. [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]
