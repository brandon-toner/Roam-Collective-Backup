                            - My suspicion is that unless some original text is added with the block ref in your [[bookmarks]] section, the block refs you are adding to you Bookmarks section will be unavailable for [query]([[querying]]). [@Sam]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]])
                                - This is because the markdown in YOUR section will only be the `((jslkdjrls))` block ID code gibberish.
        - #Q What are the [[glossary]] terms related to [[spaced repetition]]?
            - #I I'd like to form a quick glossary/map of terms to facilitate more precise discussion of terms.
        - I feel like we need to tidy up the "Welcome" and "Onboarding" parts of the graph.
            - Goals::
                - I want the graph to feel approachable to a visitor. 
                    - #I Send people the link to [[Welcome]] rather than the DNP
                - I want people to be prepared for, and comfortable with a degree of [[chaos]].
                    - This feels like an article/write-up. I've got lots of thoughts on this.

                                - Have clear places to look for 
                                    - Important updates & changes (Announcements, and Change Log, in our case)
                                    - Active projects (epics and sprints, in our case)

                - #Q How is the work defined?
                    - Options
                        - Leader goes depth-first, mapping the scope, purpose, objectives, and tasks. Then everyone chips away at the work as it is defined.
                            - Pros::
                                - Leader can "pave the way" and others can easily identify work to contribute to.
                            - Cons:: 
                                - The leader can become a bottleneck.
                                - Other options/opportunites could be missed.
                                - Risk of less buy-in engagement if people are less "part of the process"
                        - Everyone brainstorms to define the work, then the leader decides on the direction (using the overall mission, vision and values of the organization/community to guide the decision)
                            - Pros::
                                - Everyone has an opportunity to contribute to the direction of work.
                                - More collective buy-in and commitment to the work and direction of development.
                                - Leader has more information available to make a good decision.
                            - Cons::
                                - Can be more chaotic and exploratory.
                                - Can be harder to get things "off the ground".
                                - More onus/work on community members to both define/then do, the work.
                        - Thoughts::
                            - The best is a blend of these approaches, and likely one that is [[opportunistic]]: 
                                - As leaders or group members become clear on work that could/should be done ‚Äî they define it. 
                                - As members are inspired to do work, they do it.

        1. [@Sam]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) on [[roam-inter]] "I'm going to try extracting the big ideas, the remaining challenges to be solved, what questions this raises, and what this could mean for the future of roam multiplayer."
            - These are the main points that I don't yet understand, but would be interested in knowing. 
            - Even simply: What can it do? What are the limitations?
                - Where does it insert blocks?
                    - Nested beneath a designated parent?
                    - What happens if that parent is deleted?
        2. [@Sam]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) "On [the value of making ideas more accessible](((KpVmFpyiw))) for collaborative innovation"
            - There is a fleeting note (or several) in there ‚Äî **I can feel it haha.**
                - Toss a `#FN` tag and make a claim. (use these liberally)
                    - e.g.
                        - #FN [[summarizing]] complex ideas into [atomic]([[atomic]]) chunks makes them more easily digestible for others.
                            - #FN When you reduce the amount of effort necessary to understand an idea, you increase the amount of people that can build on it.[*](((dBkUYuwoz)))[*]([[zettelkasten]])[*]([[collaboration]])
                                - This is THE REASON for creating a for mapping the [[dependencies]] between ideas[*]([[Epics/Managing knowledge dependencies in multiplayer]]) and probably the [[mission]] of [[Roam]].
                            - #Q What information is best to "get from the source" on vs a summary?
                                - #Ans When the accuracy and precision of the idea is crucial to it's usage / when you are unable to trust the summarizing source.
                                    - This is NOT very often.
                                        - #FN It is often impractical or impossible to complete all of the background readings on a subject yourself. Let alone many subjects...
                                            - #FN We RELY on the [[summaries]] generated by others, in order to integrate a large amount of information into our [[thinking]].
                                            - #FN a [[collaborative graph]] offers the ability to maintain a chain of influence ‚Äî enhancing the custom of source [[citation]].
                                                - This has the potential to improve both recreational and professional knowledge work.

        4. Simple Replies
            - "I use the `#Follow Up` block in this way, but it's not perfect"
                - I do this as well ‚Äî and will sometimes add a tag if I want to add it to the linked references/query results with other information.
        5. [@Charles]([[~[[Charles Farr]]]]) on [Bookmarks](((RbE7YKTsL)))
            - Right now our behaviour on bookmarks isnt block-level though... We nest multiple bookmarks under a single `#Bookmarks` tag.
                - The beauty of this workflow is I can filter `Bookmarks` by `bnt` to see mine, by `csf` to see yours etc. And further filter by `Follow Up` to see that intersection.
                - I wouldn't consider Bookmarks a block-level tag. 
        6. [@Sam]([[~[[Samuel Bars]]]]) on [Zettelkasten](((6TxFuxypY)))
            - The same thing could be done using the block-level tags. I often jump right into the fleeting notes if I have the clarity to do so on the topic, or **I'll write more until I do**... or ask more questions.
                - The goal is a self-directed conversation that you mediate and tag using the block level tags.
                - Capturing clarity of thought as it surfaces in whatever form it presents.
                - Still very bottom-up. The option to write-to-think without block-tags is still there and encouraged.
            - 
        7. [@Wade]([[@[[Wade Dominic]]]]) coming in HOT with the expert-level `#My Wins` [tag](((EglComi8g)))! 
            - The graph looks DOPE!! Nice to see the conventions from here port so well in another graph. Amazing.

What's your take on fleeting notes that come from personal experience/journaling sessions?
                        - [[Beau Haan]] I have a Project Zettelkasten, structured the same way, but without the Literature Notes (since I am the author) and the Reference Note links to the URL of the journaling ‚Äî But I have these Project notes completely fire-walled from the main Zettelkasten in order to keep my dialogue partner as formidable as possible. 
                            - But I actually prefer to use the journaling as a way to play with ideas and then when I stumble upon an article that resonates with me‚ÄîI take that and create new Permanent Notes in the main Zettelkasten, since then the information is useful over time, compounding
                - 3 levels of analysis
                    - Structure
                        - 1st level = Siblings under `#[[Fleeting Notes]]` parent blocks
                        - 2nd level = going back to blocks from level 1 and nesting abstraction/expansion underneath
                        - 3rd level = summarizing the whole note on the parent level block, next to `#[[Fleeting Notes]]`

            - "What are your thoughts?"
                - Maybe not journaling but certainly a more reflective process, and less focused on blocks compared to RC
                    - With how you guys do it here, it's breaking down thinking block by block. Beau uses a "wall of text", multiple blocks, for one fleeting note, permanent note, etc.
                        - I guess the idea is that the divergence at the beginning, when you're writing a fleeting note, is less important for him to resurface, and he wants to focus attention on the parent block, where the big idea is summarized (calls them "thumbnails")
                        - He's training us, with the daily writing sessions, to write freely and extensively, and then abstract from that. Less focus on being clear and intentional about what you're writing from the start, it's a wild free ride, but then going back and abstracting
                            - bottom up
                            - Writing to think, then hiding that (although you can come back for context) and collapsing it under "thumbnails" of thought

        - On the value of [[block-level tags]]
            - More and more, I am realizing that I use the `#` functionally in a fundamentally different way that standard `[[]]` page references. The biggest different is when I use a `#` I rarely plan on visiting the page. Instead, I am looking to surface the associated blocks through queries at some future time.
                - #FN A users planned method of [[information retrieval]] will impact all of the [[knowledge]] [[structure]]s they prefer using
                    - #therefore "#FN Educating new users of [[knowledge graphs]] on the power of [[discoverability]] and the available [[search]] functions is critical to [[onboarding]]"
                        - #FN Educating new users of [[knowledge graphs]] on the power of [[discoverability]] and the available [[search]] functions is critical to [[onboarding]]
                - Under this usage of the `#` convention, there are essentially two sub-conventions ‚Äî using the `#` as [[section tags]] and as [[block-level tags]].
                    - I see section tags as being used best to aggregate **general** thoughts and information. They are scratchpads of one form or another. The information that is contained is either prose (like this) or unrefined ideas.
                        - #FN [Section-level tags]([[section tags]]) should be used to aggregate loosely held ideas and general thoughts.
                    - I see block-level tags as being used best to summarize **atomic** and **focused** thoughts (of varying types and maturities). The information at the level of the block level tag should be digestible on its own, with context nested underneath. The context can be terse or flowing, rough or developed, but the priority for the highest block should be **concise** as hell.
                        - #FN [Block-level tags]([[block-level tags]]) should be used to summarize atomic and focused thoughts and pieces of knowledge
                - One of the [[implicit]] differences between these [two tag types](((loZtX8kki))) ‚Äî [[block-level tags]] and [[section tags]] ‚Äî  is their [[maturity]].
                    - A thought that can be summarized in a single-block is at least somewhat thought out. One that requires an entire section may be chipping away at a unified idea, but the final understanding/idea is still [fluid]([[fluidity]]).
            - Taking all of the above into account, we can use the implicit distinct between [[block-level tags]] and [[section tags]] to help [parse](((AcVV2n11w))) out [[signal]] versus [[noise]].
                - #FN [Block-level tags]([[block-level tags]]) tags can effectively increase the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] by proactively parsing out [mature]([[maturity]]) thoughts.
            - Block-level tags tangentially related benefits as well...
                - They allow for the identification and summarization of high-quality thoughts anywhere in the graph.
                    - Often this leads to creation in-line with important contextual information.
                    - Viewing the though-processes around [[idea formation]] increasing  [[traceability]] of our own and others' thought processes, ultimately allowing for easier [[comprehension]] and greater [[cross-pollination]] of ideas.

            - [@Brandon]([[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]) I think that one of the biggest reasons why I like singular for [[block-level tags]] is that it distinguishes between an atomic block and a collection.
                - `#Bookmark` is a block-level bookmark
                - `[[Bookmarks]]` is a collection of `#Bookmark` blocks
