    - #Scratchpad 
        - #Q How do you manage the problem of community fragmentation?
            - i.e. as similar communities with similar missions form, how do you allocate your attention?
                - The potential future issue that I see is one of re-work. And spreading ideas too-thin.
                    - The collective model somewhat relies on a minimum threshold of engagement that increases as the diversity of topics widens. 
                        - More diverse range of questions and topics = more engagement and members required for meaningful convergence on related topics.
        - #[[FN]] [[maxims]] are practical and easily communicated distillations of knowledge.
            - They serve to summarize and crystallize a piece of wisdom.
            - #I Collecting [[maxims]] central to a domain might be helpful for mapping the territory of knowledge.
            - #Q Are [[mental models]] maxims?
                - I think many could be considered maxims. The format is similar. 
                - I like the term "maxim" better. It feels less trendy, carrying less baggage from modern use and discussion.
                - While many mental models might be considered maxims, going the other way feels kinda awkward...
                    - #Q Is "a watched pot never boils" a mental model?
                        - Feels less so. 
                        - Maxims feel more proverbial than mental models.
                            - #I Maxims may encompass both mental models and proverbs. 
                                - "[[maxims]] feels less religiously charged than [[proverbs]] "
                                - "#[[FN]] The purpose of my [[zettelkasten]] / knowledge base is to facilitate the collection and creation of proverbial wisdom. [*]([[proverbs]])"
            - #Q What is the difference between [[evergreen notes]] and [[maxims]]?[*]([[Bookmarks]])
            - Hierarchy:
                - Maxims (practical application of knowledge)
                - Claims (assertion of knowledge)
                - References (sources of claims and maxims)
                - Evidence (support for claims)
            - Process:
                - Collect maxims
                - Collect claims that establish/rationalize their value
                - Collect evidence that supports the claims
                - Collect resources related to the maxims or claims 
        - #I [[evergreen notes]] may be subdivided into [[concepts]], [[claims]], and [[maxims]].
            - [[concepts]] = definitional
            - [[claims]] = assertions of truths 
            - [[maxims]] = core principles / practical rules of conduct ‚Äî or [[directives]].
