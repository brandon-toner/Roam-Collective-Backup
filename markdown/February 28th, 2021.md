        - #Q How do you manage the problem of community fragmentation?
            - i.e. as similar communities with similar missions form, how do you allocate your attention?
                - The potential future issue that I see is one of re-work. And spreading ideas too-thin.
                    - The collective model somewhat relies on a minimum threshold of engagement that increases as the diversity of topics widens. 
                        - More diverse range of questions and topics = more engagement and members required for meaningful convergence on related topics.
        - #[[FN]] [[maxims]] are practical and easily communicated distillations of knowledge.
            - They serve to summarize and crystallize a piece of wisdom.
            - #I Collecting [[maxims]] central to a domain might be helpful for mapping the territory of knowledge.
            - #Q Are [[mental models]] maxims?
                - I think many could be considered maxims. The format is similar. 
                - I like the term "maxim" better. It feels less trendy, carrying less baggage from modern use and discussion.
                - While many mental models might be considered maxims, going the other way feels kinda awkward...
                    - #Q Is "a watched pot never boils" a mental model?
                        - Feels less so. 
                        - Maxims feel more proverbial than mental models.
                            - #I Maxims may encompass both mental models and proverbs. 
                                - "[[maxims]] feels less religiously charged than [[proverbs]] "
                                - "#[[FN]] The purpose of my [[zettelkasten]] / knowledge base is to facilitate the collection and creation of proverbial wisdom. [*]([[proverbs]])"
            - #Q What are the differences between [[evergreen notes]] and [[maxims]]?[*]([[Bookmarks]])
                - #Q Is an evergreen note a maxim?
                    - And if so, 
                        - Are all maxims evergreen notes?
                            - And if so, 
                                - #Q Should [[maxims]] bear the `Evergreens/` namespace?
                                    - "#[[FN]] use [[namespaces]] sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way."
                                        - "#I In this sense, I am tempted to remove namespacing for evergreen notes entirely... "
            - #Q What are the differences between [[maxims]] and [[principles]]?
                - I would wager: 
                    - All principles are maxims, but not all maxims are principles.
                    - Maxims can be more proverbial than principles.
                - #Q What is a principle?
            - Hierarchy:
                - Maxims (practical application of knowledge)
                - Claims (assertion of knowledge)
                - References (sources of claims and maxims)
                - Evidence (support for claims)
            - Process:
                - Collect maxims
                - Collect claims that establish/rationalize their value
                - Collect evidence that supports the claims
                - Collect resources related to the maxims or claims 
        - #I [[evergreen notes]] may be subdivided into [[concepts]], [[claims]], and [[maxims]].
            - [[concepts]] = definitional
            - [[claims]] = assertions of truths 
            - [[maxims]] = core principles / practical rules of conduct ‚Äî or [[directives]].
            - #Q What is missing from this framework?[*]([[Bookmarks]])
        - #[[FN]] use [[namespaces]] sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way.
            - #[[FN]] [[namespaces]] are at risk of the same issues encountered by file-folder organizational systems. 
                - "Is this a "this" or a "that"?"
            - #I In this sense, I am tempted to remove namespacing for evergreen notes entirely... 
        - [[Evergreens/Cite shared principles to foster alignment.]]
        - Today's word-cloud I'm wrestling:
            - [[maxims]]
            - [[principles]]
            - [[evergreen notes]]
            - [[mental models]]
            - [[claims]]
            - [[concepts]]
            - [[proverbs]]
            - [[directives]]
        - #[[FN]] accurate and precise category naming is more robust than metaphor or mythology naming.
            - metaphors and analogies break down ‚Äî accurate language does not.
            - #[[FN]] Metaphors should be an interpretive layer above true category naming.
    - #Conversation #not-populated
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        - Imported maxims from [[Books/12 Rules for Life]] and [[Books/Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life]] as material for reference and demonstration of structure.
            - Similar could be done for [[Ray Dalio]]'s [[Books/Principles]]

        - On building a [[semi-lattice]] structure for knowledge work...
            - #Annotations [[Essay/A City is Not a Tree]]
            - #Drafts The other day [[Conor White-Sullivan]] tweeted out a note about [[Christopher Alexander]]'s essay [[Essay/A City is Not a Tree]]. I've heard Alexander's name pop up in the roamcult before (shout out to [Matt B]([[cc:[[Matt Brockwell]]]])), so I felt compelled to dive in.
                - As Alexander thinks in terms of cities, he is naturally thinking about three-dimensional environments. His thesis is that many designers plan cities using a simple tree structure...
                    - For example...
                        - A city is made up of N neighborhoods...
                            - Neighborhood 1 contains each of the following...
                                - School district A
                                - Commercial district B
                                - Emergency area C
                            - Each of "School district A", "Commercial district B", and "Emergency area C" are wholly contained within Neighborhood 1.
                    - This example is a simple tree ‚Äî each node has one single parent node
                        - #FN [Trees]([[tree]])' structures can have many branches and levels, but they always follow the same maxim: each node has one and only one parent.
                - However, cities are much more complicated than trees ‚Äî in reality, they are [[semi-lattice]]s. In a semi-lattice, each node can have multiple parents. In this sense a semi-lattice is a more complex graph object than a tree.
                    - #FN [Semi-lattices]([[semi-lattice]]) are a type of graph, best conceptualized as layers. However, unlike a tree, objects contained within each layer can have multiple relationships with the layer above (i.e., multiple parens).
                        - Image::
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FWqDTXlkODx.jpeg?alt=media&token=db6e3bda-fd27-48b8-83ed-88d0908614a1)
                        - In the above image, there are four layers, each representing some "category" of data or metadata. Once way to understand the above semi-lattice and the dotted line could be...
                            - The dotted-line represents some data-object which is associated with different layers of metadata...
                            - (Layer 1) Each yellow triangle represents a single graph member (the object's creator) ‚Äî in this case, each block or page would only have one original creator
                            - (Layer 2) Each orange circle represents a daily notes page for a given day. A data object (not a reference to said object) belongs to a single date in time.
                            - (Layer 3) Each purple shape represents a Collection ‚Äî if the dotted line represents a Project then the project would be associated with three separate collections...
                            - (Layer 4) Each blue blob represents a concept (or a group of concepts) ‚Äî if the dotted line again represents a project, then via the collections (layer 3), the project is associated with various concepts.
                                - It is important to note here that some concepts map to multiple collections (and therefore in a [nodal view](((jId9rciJf))) would have multiple parents!)
                - My initial thoughts on how we can use the idea of a [[semi-lattice]] is as a mechanism to capture and understand the complexity of the knowledge in this graph (and all graphs...)
                    - We've explored various note mythologies and types, discussed explicit and implicit levels of maturity, gone back and forth on the usage of block-level versus page-level information. Through most of this, the idea has been to come to rational categories.
                        - While this is helpful for managing [[complexity]], rationalizing categories and their sub-components inevitably reduces the richness of information.
                    - If I were to offer a tentative recommendation of how we could utilize the conceptual framework of a [[semi-lattice]], it would be to begin thinking about  different layers of data and meta-data.
                        - A few layers of interest might be....
                            - Node-type: block versus page
                            - Zettel note type: [[fleeting notes]] versus [[literature notes]] versus [[permanent notes]]
                            - Synthesis note type: context versus observation/evidence versus proposition/claim/notion versus synthesis
                            - Level of collaboration: individual thought versus community curation versus community driven
                            - Collection membership: Notetaking versus Networked Thought versus Spaced Repetition versus ...
                            - Concept relationships: notetaking versus networked thought versus spaced repetition versus ...
                        - The layers are quite literally infinite, so some rationalization is most **definitely** required.
                    - ...
                - Calling it for the evening, but looking forward to exploring the idea of a [[semi-lattice]] and its multitude of [[layers]] in the future
