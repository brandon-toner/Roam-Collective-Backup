    - #Scratchpad 
        - #Q How do you manage the problem of community fragmentation?
            - i.e. as similar communities with similar missions form, how do you allocate your attention?
                - The potential future issue that I see is one of re-work. And spreading ideas too-thin.
                    - The collective model somewhat relies on a minimum threshold of engagement that increases as the diversity of topics widens. 
                        - More diverse range of questions and topics = more engagement and members required for meaningful convergence on related topics.
        - #[[FN]] [[maxims]] are practical and easily communicated distillations of knowledge.
            - They serve to summarize and crystallize a piece of wisdom.
            - #I Collecting [[maxims]] central to a domain might be helpful for mapping the territory of knowledge.
            - #Q Are [[mental models]] maxims?
                - I think many could be considered maxims. The format is similar. 
                - I like the term "maxim" better. It feels less trendy, carrying less baggage from modern use and discussion.
                - While many mental models might be considered maxims, going the other way feels kinda awkward...
                    - #Q Is "a watched pot never boils" a mental model?
                        - Feels less so. 
                        - Maxims feel more proverbial than mental models.
                            - #I Maxims may encompass both mental models and proverbs. 
                                - "[[maxims]] feels less religiously charged than [[proverbs]] "
                                - "#[[FN]] The purpose of my [[zettelkasten]] / knowledge base is to facilitate the collection and creation of proverbial wisdom. [*]([[proverbs]])"
            - #Q What are the differences between [[evergreen notes]] and [[maxims]]?[*]([[Bookmarks]])
                - #Q Is an evergreen note a maxim?
                    - And if so, 
                        - Are all maxims evergreen notes?
                            - And if so, 
                                - #Q Should [[maxims]] bear the `Evergreens/` namespace?
                                    - "#[[FN]] use [[namespaces]] sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way."
                                        - "#I In this sense, I am tempted to remove namespacing for evergreen notes entirely... "
            - #Q What are the differences between [[maxims]] and [[principles]]?
                - I would wager: 
                    - All principles are maxims, but not all maxims are principles.
                    - Maxims can be more proverbial than principles.
                - #Q What is a principle?
            - Hierarchy:
                - Maxims (practical application of knowledge)
                - Claims (assertion of knowledge)
                - References (sources of claims and maxims)
                - Evidence (support for claims)
            - Process:
                - Collect maxims
                - Collect claims that establish/rationalize their value
                - Collect evidence that supports the claims
                - Collect resources related to the maxims or claims 
        - #I [[evergreen notes]] may be subdivided into [[concepts]], [[claims]], and [[maxims]].
            - [[concepts]] = definitional
            - [[claims]] = assertions of truths 
            - [[maxims]] = core principles / practical rules of conduct ‚Äî or [[directives]].
            - #Q What is missing from this framework?[*]([[Bookmarks]])
        - #[[FN]] use [[namespaces]] sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way.
            - #[[FN]] [[namespaces]] are at risk of the same issues encountered by file-folder organizational systems. 
                - "Is this a "this" or a "that"?"
            - #I In this sense, I am tempted to remove namespacing for evergreen notes entirely... 
        - [[Evergreens/Cite shared principles to foster alignment.]]
        - Today's word-cloud I'm wrestling:
            - [[maxims]]
            - [[principles]]
            - [[evergreen notes]]
            - [[mental models]]
            - [[claims]]
            - [[concepts]]
            - [[proverbs]]
            - [[directives]]
        - #[[FN]] accurate and precise category naming is more robust than metaphor or mythology naming.
            - metaphors and analogies break down ‚Äî accurate language does not.
            - #[[FN]] Metaphors should be an interpretive layer above true category naming.
    - #Conversation #not-populated
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        - Imported maxims from [[Books/12 Rules for Life]] and [[Books/Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life]] as material for reference and demonstration of structure.
            - Similar could be done for [[Ray Dalio]]'s [[Books/Principles]]
