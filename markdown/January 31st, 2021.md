- #[[My Daily Notes]] [[Brandon Toner]] {{word-count}} [*]([[bnt]])
    - #[[Scratchpad]] 
        - #Tips 
            - For [[SmartBlocks]] that **do not contain any commands**, launch using the native Roam template engine for faster performance `;;`
            - Use `CTRL+Hover` to preview a page or a block reference using [[Roam42]] [[Live Preview]]
                - This is helpful when using something like the [random fleeting notes](((9j2PVNMXj))) SmartBlock to be able to quickly view for who authored the note (it'll show in the [[breadcrumbs]]).
            - Be mindful of click points when clicking a [complex page]([[complex page names]]) link. To visit the page, click on a part that DOES NOT have a subpage. 
                - Active [CSS for nested pages](((y9rumn-yn))) helps to determine what part of the page is selected.
        - #Observations
            - A new DNP can begin as quite empty. A new visitor to the graph may not think to "go back a day" to see most recent content. 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] the blank [[DNP]] and [this effect](((92Z_Zq-zn))) provides incentive to write each day to keep the graph momentum going.
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Keeping up the [[momentum]] is important in a [[collaborative graph]] to keep it interesting and worthwhile for participants.
                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Keeping up with [[notifications]] "is important in a [[collaborative graph]] to keep it interesting and worthwhile for participants." [*](((JI1BnXUtL)))
        - #[[Development Requests]] #[[Help Wanted]]
            - Is there a way to reorder sibling blocks by various parameters:

                - Charle's detailed thoughts [here](((sBu3zOPiV)))
            - Objectives::
                - Have [[pages]] for commonly referenced ideas.
                - Clear authorship.
                - [[[[E:]] low floor, high ceiling]] workflow
                - Ease of [[onboarding]].
                - Clear [[disambiguation]]
                - Minimize [[cognitive burden]] associated with too many tags [*](((Ur95KwfFX)))
                - Clearly detect level of [[maturity]].
                - Easy to find, reference, and filter.
                - Allow for ease in generating [[output]].
            - Thoughts::
                - On [[authorship]]:[*](((IWQC9aRN8)))
                    - A common occurrence may be that the TITLE of an evergreen note may be verbatim from another writer, but the elaborations or thoughts on that idea may be your own.
                        - #Q How do you differentiate title authorship from body authorship?
                            - For the purposes of avoiding [[plagarism]] and generating accurate [[references]].
                - On [[order]] of notes within the [[zettelkasten]]:
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[Sonke Ahrens]] describes that the order of notes within a [[zettelkasten]] matters as much as the content of the notes themselves.
                    - This is especially emphasized within [[Beau Hann]]'s expression of [[zettelkasten]].
                    - #Q How can the order of notes within the zettelkasten be represented in this emerging system?
                        - The [block referenced aspects](((Kq6jZZIYI))) of the zettelkasten note template proposed by [[Charles Farr]] may be of use here.
                    - #Q How do you integrate ideas from various authors within a [[zettelkasten]]? In respect to note order.
                - On note [[maturity]]:
                    - In the future, as aspects of [[epistemology]] are integrated into the [[zettelkasten]], an attribute could be created that helps to filter notes by the method of arrival at the idea. 
                        - "Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?"
                    - #Q How does the [[seedlings]] concept fit in here?
                        - Maybe the current expression of "#Evergreens Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims" as a block (not a page), is better expressed as a seedling to improve [disambiguation](((QyZaIx66_))).
                            - Replace tree with seedling emoji, same effect.
                        - Maybe all fleeting notes are seedlings?
                        - #Q Whats the difference between a seedling and a fleeting note?
                - On epistemology:
                    - "In the future, as aspects of [[epistemology]] are integrated into the [[zettelkasten]], an attribute could be created that helps to filter notes by the method of arrival at the idea. "
                        - "Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?"
                - On "However, to efficiently transit it to others, it needs to be more than a page title — you have to flesh it out"
                    - While I agree, I think the "fleshing it out" occurs over time. More detail can be requested by other readers, prompting the original author to further elaborate. 
                    - Getting a note to page status does help with the use of the idea around the database, if it is a commonly referenced idea. [[[[E:]] knowledge graphs should be populated opportunistically to optimize for flow state writing.]]
                    - I see more detail as [[[[E:]] beneficial, but optional]]
            - Questions::
                - #Q How does [this system](((sBu3zOPiV))) provide a difference in generating [[output]]?
                - #Q How can a [[conversation]] be best facilitated among the notes of the [[zettelkasten]]?
                - #Q How can systems be streamlined such that it is clear, and easy to adopt for [[new users]] or [[graph members]]?
                - #Q How can [[questions]] be integrated in to [[zettelkasten]]?
                    - Related:: 
                        - "#Q How should questions be incorporated in the zettelkasten (e.g., with fleeting, literature, or evergreen notes)"
                        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[evergreen notes]] and [[zettel questions]] should be very familiar to group members to facilitate their frequent tagging in related [[resources]], [[ideas]] and [[discussions]]."

            - Process:: [*]([[Processes]])
                - Document ideas freely as [[fleeting notes]]
                - [[literature notes]] or [[verbatim notes]] are representations of the author's ideas.
                    - OK to be verbatim — these should be quick & easy! 
                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The need for originality adds [[cognitive burden]].

                - As ideas begin to feel [[evergreen]], a page should be created.
                    - The body of a fleeting note could be made into a page.

                    - Questions as one of the [[DNP Modules]] and a [[collections]] tag.
                    - `#Q` at the block level to flag individual questions.
                    - As a question [matures]([[maturation]]), it should be transformed into a page. There should be a [Questions template](((HBqwZEBCv))) with `Tags:: #Questions` included. 
                    - A [secondary tag](((IX96gb5b6))) could be implemented to further refine to [[important questions]] or [[zettel questions]].

                    - Open Questions
                    - Context Questions
                    - Zettel Questions 
        10. Making the shift from **"Comments"** to **"Conversation"** in the DNP Modules.

                    - fleeting: 
                        - fully formed questions, designed to be able elicit reflection or discussion. It should be context independent and fully formed.

        2. #[[Graph Mentorship]]
            - While making [[fleeting notes]], try to make them into full descriptive sentences so that they make more sense in isolation from their original context. I generally use the guidance of [[[[E:]] Evergreen note titles are like APIs]] to apply to fleeting notes. 
The difference is that FNs are a bit more "rough" or less timeless in their content. They may be redundant with other notes, or require some further thinking. That's ok, that's the purpose of the note class.

            - "Given how unbounded Roam can be, could it be helpful to present the quick steps as a video?"

                    - Within your [[DNP Section]] is perfect. The conventions are still kinda emergent for this, but I like how you did it. I see "within your DNP" as a personal log, while pinned to the top as a global log. Central might be better for visibility... will [[sleep on it]].

            - **Definition**: (Logical) structure that could be contained within a single block ((one way to understand this is, using one sentence to conclude what you wanna express)).
            - **Significance**: Based on this semantic, we could design block based CSS, which could convey structure in a visual way. 
            - Example:: Actually, we could think of current `#Fleeting Notes` and `#Evergreen` a kind of "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]".
            - Example:: Try to think of the following situation, saying that I want to **distinguish two concepts by introducing their difference**. 
""#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-embed [[model]]" conveys information in a rather ‘networked way’ while "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]" conveys information in a ‘linear way’. #[[.concept/difference]]"

            - **Origin**: This is a concept I come up when I try to generalize the AXYZ [[model]] ((A do X under Y condition and observe Z)) purposed by [[Joel Chan]], based on my own understanding.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] block-embed [[model]]
            - Example:: {{[[embed]]: ((zFyFH7Z_m))}}

        - I understand your hesitation [here](((Z4Z2VoSX-))), visual cue is quite useful for new come Roaman, they could get what you mean at a glance, **iff.** these visual cue don’t get mess together ((like using more than two fleeting notes at the same time)) and [[aliases]] serve the job to hide these messy situation. Or in other words, our [[visual cues]] are not able to mix/compose together within a block. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]
            - So, technically, is there a pure css way to change css appearance when the block is referenced? There should be a JS way to do so. #[[Experiments]]
                - Example:: When the fleeting notes is referenced, the fleeting note content should be erased, and instead, the referenced one’s background color will become yellow to indicate that it’s a fleeting note in a little bit implicit way, rather than hide its nature purely in [[aliases]].

            - Saying that we are able to render the block based on its inner structure(manually or automatically), then we’re able to **get intention of author** at a glance(e.g. fleeting notes block). But the **first step** to achieve this, is that we might need to **find out some fundamental** [[patterns]] we tend to use in block ((AXYZ model from Joel Chan is one example)).

            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Learning [[collaboration]] requires separate clear shared [[goals]], to enable the process of learning collaboration to serve as a meta-goal
                - Epistemic status:  strongly held belief, shaped by personal experience managing teams and project managing myself on Roam
                - It's hard to have learning to collaborate be the sole goal, as it's then difficult to measure and assess progress.  How do you think about whether one is collaborating enough?  How does one measure success in the collaboration?
                - It's possible that I'm overly anchored on the one Roam Game that's stated re: project management.  In my own experience incorporating Roam into project management, it took some experimentation by thoughtfully asking myself: is this current workflow enabling me to make progress across my multitude of projects?  It wasn't about the workflow in and of itself, but about how the workflow was a tool towards 
                - My working hypothesis is that given how unbounded and malleable Roam is, the ideal project management structure will likely depend greatly on the type of project (e.g., short vs. long, high collaboration vs. separable).  It will be a family of principles, rather than a universal one.  
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Building norms for collaboration in a distributed setting might require very structured initiation, that may feel antithetic to Roam
                - Epistemic status:  intuition that needs to be stress-tested
                - Perhaps I'm overly anchored by recency bias from having read Bret Victor's [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) yesterday and the harms of interactivity
                - Within Victor's definition, Roam is clearly a manipulation software and not an information software; but it has an incredible malleability that makes its a multi-purpose tool.  How best to work and shape the tool will depend on the objective.  
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Effective teaming requires clear norms and expectations
                    - Epistemic status:  business truism, true to my experience - but need to think about how a digital environment of loosely connected people may lead to a different definition of "effective", "clear", "norms" and "expectations"

        - The "About Roam Collective" page feels hidden - I know it's in the sidebar, but I think it would be quite helpful to have it in the recommended path in the steps to getting started
            - I was struck that the help provided a lot of instructions but I had to go looking for what the mission and goals of the Roam Collective were.  
            - In my initial exploration, I stumbled upon the Projects page because I asked myself if there was one.  I would imagine Projects - defining them as a community and deciding which ones to join as an individual - are a foundational step towards building effective collaboration 
        - Given how unbounded Roam can be, could it be helpful to present the quick steps as a video?
        - WOW - so cool: when a reference appeared to the block I wrote above, a message also appeared noting there was an unread reference 
            - Wonder how this works, and how it might work for blocks with multiple authors (although not sure authorship is tracked as blocks are showing up as "anonymous")
                - Seems like all my unread references are showing up, regardless if its a thread I was reading.  Will see how this looks next time I log in
        - Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?

At least, I think there could be some interesting experimentation around building collective knowledge that build from individual knowledge basis
            - "I'd place this within a Daily Log module instead. "

                    - For the specific goal of knowing who is "online" and to facilitate in-roam conversations (such as the one we are having), it could suffice to have a tag to signal that (e.g., "live now" or some other convention).  Then it doesn't have to be up top on the daily note

    - #Conversation
        - "Check this out, [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] [Namespace choice AoT](((u8etVKAtE)))"
            - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] I like the AOT but disagree with the choice!
                - My stance remains that there are a ton of benefits to having an identifier in the actual page title
                - See my [comments yesterday](((dg-k5f3s6))) for some more thoughts on Evergreen notes
        - "#Q How should we disambiguate between the various types of question tags? #Bookmarks [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]"
            - My preference is to limit it to a parent-level tag and then a block level tag
                - This would look like
                    - `#Questions`
                        - `#Q` Why is it important to limit the number of tags used in a graph?
                - Benefits
                    - Limits the cognitive burden associated with tagging correctly
                    - Easily extensible
                        - Add an additional tag to add queryable context
                            - #Questions
                                - #Conventions
                                    - #Q Why is it important to limit the number of tags used in a graph?
                                - #zettelkasten
                                    - #Q How should questions be incorporated in the zettelkasten (e.g., with fleeting, literature, or evergreen notes)
                - Downsides
                    - Context is implicit, not explicit
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[tagging]] [[conventions]] should lean on using tag combinations as opposed to compound tags
                - Tag combinations reduce the total number of tags required of the user to remember — easing cognitive burden is helpful during onboarding and can sustain participation
                    - Compound tags almost always have more detailed and specific definitions — not easy to pick up rapidly in a large graph
        - "E vs Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes all as active tags feels challenging for [[disambiguation]]."
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] makes complete sense — I think we can consolidate it down to be a bit more manageable
                - If I were to build an updated format, this is what it might look like...
                    - [[[[E:]] Evergreen Note example 1]]
        - "Thinking of making the switch... thoughts [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]?"
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I actually proposed this to Matt haha
                - But yeah I agree — any type of communication, either with reference to a block or not would easily be captured by the `#Converation` block...
        - "[[~[[Charles Farr]]]] Check [this](((3u0iEUdbd))) out.

I'm thinking we could adjust the buttons more specifically for out needs.
- TODO (this sprint)

If BLOCKMENTIONS worked with the regular query engine this would be VERY powerful.[*]([[Roam Enhancement Requests]])"
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I like this SmartBlock a lot
                - Question that immediately jumps to mind is...
                    - #Q What is the value of recreating lists of TODOs on the Daily Note versus pulling from some central repository?
                        - In my head, the central repository could be a set of "dashboards" that help to track both live and completed tasks...
                            - In this way, it's very similar to some of the more established project management tools (e.g., Asana, Trello)
                            - The big difference is being able to tie work in Roam directly to the task and the project...
    - #[[Change Log]]
        - Added CSS to eliminate the `#Evergreen` from block references, leaving only the icon
            - See CSS here: "In Block Reference"
            - Example: "#Evergreens Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims"
            - Allows for seamless inline referencing of Evergreen notes
    - #[[GTD Zone]]

        - Hey [[~[[Larissa de Lima]]]] 👋🏼! Just checked out your twitter and I'm pretty sure we were at OW for quite some time! I just left at the beginning of December.
            - Would love to connect sometime to hear about your work at OW Forum!
