    - Objectives:: 
        - Create a [[Roam Collaboration Guide]]
        - {{[[DONE]]}} Create a hub for the [[Roam Games]]
    - Tips:: 
        - Click on any bullet to "zoom in" for a more focused perspective (reducing the noise, and focusing on your section) - this also helps with stability if there are a lot of us writing simultaneously.
        - Check out the #[[Help Wanted]] page references for opportunities to contribute.
        - Check out [[January 25th, 2021]] for some great examples of the conventions in motion.
        - **Jump right in!** [I'll]([[Brandon Toner]]) be moderating so will be able to provide guidance/feedback as you create blocks.
        - Check out the #[[N]] linked references for some [[atomic ideas]].
            - Reference them under a #Conversation block within your [[DNP Section]] to add some commentary.
        - Document your ideas in [the collective zettelkasten]([[zettelkasten]]) to improve their longevity and connection to other ideas in the database.
        - [[Create new pages freely, in keeping with the conventions.]] 
            - If making a new [collection]([[collections]]), document within your [[change log]].
    - **Catching up on the action**
        - Check the #[[Change Log]] linked references for a running list of the changes over time.
        - Check the #Announcements linked references for a running list of important memos
        - Quickly scan some previous DNP pages to browse for interesting content and observe some conventions in action.
        - Explore the block references on the [[Prompts]] page to see community responses to various prompts

    9. Making the shift from several questions formats to a **simplified** setup. #Conventions
        - #Questions = [DNP Module Tag]([[DNP Modules]]) and [Collections]([[collections]]) tag
        - #Q = block level tag. 
            - This one should be used at the block level to flag a block as a question. 
        - Notes::
            - The following tags are now retired, with deactivated CSS:
                - Open Questions
                - Context Questions
                - Zettel Questions 
    10. Making the shift from **"Comments"** to **"Conversation"** in the DNP Modules. 
        - `Chat` should be reserved for the top-section for now.
        - `Conversation` as a DNP Module as opposed to Chat + Comments.

        - #Tips 
            - For [[SmartBlocks]] that **do not contain any commands**, launch using the native Roam template engine for faster performance `;;`
            - Use `CTRL+Hover` to preview a page or a block reference using [[Roam42]] [[Live Preview]]
                - This is helpful when using something like the [random fleeting notes](((9j2PVNMXj))) SmartBlock to be able to quickly view for who authored the note (it'll show in the [[breadcrumbs]]).
            - Be mindful of click points when clicking a [complex page]([[complex page names]]) link. To visit the page, click on a part that DOES NOT have a subpage. 
                - Active [CSS for nested pages](((y9rumn-yn))) helps to determine what part of the page is selected.
        - #Observations
            - A new DNP can begin as quite empty. A new visitor to the graph may not think to "go back a day" to see most recent content. 
                - #[[N]] the blank [[DNP]] and [this effect](((92Z_Zq-zn))) provides incentive to write each day to keep the graph momentum going.
                    - #[[N]] Keeping up the [[momentum]] is important in a [collaborative graph]([[collaborative graphs]]) to keep it interesting and worthwhile for participants.
                        - #[[N]] Keeping up with [[notifications]] "is important in a [collaborative graph]([[collaborative graphs]]) to keep it interesting and worthwhile for participants." [*](((JI1BnXUtL)))
        - #[[Development Requests]] #[[Help Wanted]]
            - Is there a way to reorder sibling blocks by various parameters:
                - Date created
                - [[alphabetical order]] (of primary interest, particularly [here](**Pages authored by graph members:**))
        - Thoughts on [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]]) [conventions]([[Conventions]]). #zettelkasten [*]([[Bookmarks]])

                - Charle's detailed thoughts [here](((sBu3zOPiV)))
            - Objectives::
                - Have [[pages]] for commonly referenced ideas.
                - Clear authorship.
                - [[Evergreens/low floor, high ceiling]] workflow
                - Ease of [[onboarding]].
                - Clear [[disambiguation]]
                - Minimize [[cognitive burden]] associated with too many tags [*](((Ur95KwfFX)))
                - Clearly detect level of [[maturity]].
                - Easy to find, reference, and filter.
                - Allow for ease in generating [[output]].
            - Thoughts::
                - On [[authorship]]:[*](((IWQC9aRN8)))
                    - A common occurrence may be that the TITLE of an evergreen note may be verbatim from another writer, but the elaborations or thoughts on that idea may be your own.
                        - #Q How do you differentiate title authorship from body authorship?
                            - For the purposes of avoiding [[plagarism]] and generating accurate [[references]].
                - On [[order]] of notes within the [[zettelkasten]]:
                    - #[[N]] [[Sonke Ahrens]] describes that the order of notes within a [[zettelkasten]] matters as much as the content of the notes themselves.
                    - This is especially emphasized within [[Beau Hann]]'s expression of [[zettelkasten]].
                    - #Q How can the order of notes within the zettelkasten be represented in this emerging system?
                        - The [block referenced aspects](((Kq6jZZIYI))) of the zettelkasten note template proposed by [[Charles Farr]] may be of use here.
                    - #Q How do you integrate ideas from various authors within a [[zettelkasten]]? In respect to note order.
                - On note [[maturity]]:
                    - In the future, as aspects of [[epistemology]] are integrated into the [[zettelkasten]], an attribute could be created that helps to filter notes by the method of arrival at the idea. 
                        - Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?
                    - #Q How does the [[seedlings]] concept fit in here?
                        - Maybe the current expression of #Evergreens Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims as a block (not a page), is better expressed as a seedling to improve [disambiguation](((QyZaIx66_))).
                            - Replace tree with seedling emoji, same effect.
                        - Maybe all fleeting notes are seedlings?
                        - #Q Whats the difference between a seedling and a fleeting note?
                - On epistemology:
                    - In the future, as aspects of [[epistemology]] are integrated into the [[zettelkasten]], an attribute could be created that helps to filter notes by the method of arrival at the idea. 
                        - Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?
                - On However, to efficiently transit it to others, it needs to be more than a page title — you have to flesh it out
                    - While I agree, I think the "fleshing it out" occurs over time. More detail can be requested by other readers, prompting the original author to further elaborate. 
                    - Getting a note to page status does help with the use of the idea around the database, if it is a commonly referenced idea. [[Seedlings/knowledge graphs should be populated opportunistically to optimize for flow state writing.]]
                    - I see more detail as [[Evergreens/beneficial, but optional]]
            - Questions::
                - #Q How does [this system](((sBu3zOPiV))) provide a difference in generating [[output]]?
                - #Q How can a [[conversation]] be best facilitated among the notes of the [[zettelkasten]]?
                - #Q How can systems be streamlined such that it is clear, and easy to adopt for [[new users]] or [[graph members]]?
                - #Q How can [[questions]] be integrated in to [[zettelkasten]]?
                    - Related:: 
                        - #Q How should questions be incorporated in the zettelkasten (e.g., with fleeting, literature, or evergreen notes)
                        - #[[N]] [[evergreen notes]] and [[zettel questions]] should be very familiar to group members to facilitate their frequent tagging in related [[resources]], [[ideas]] and [[discussions]].
                        - Do I use Q, Questions, Open Questions, Context Questions, Zettel Questions?
                        - My preference is to limit it to a parent-level tag and then a block level tag
                - #Q How can "important questions" or "research questions" that are of central importance be integrated into the [[zettelkasten]]?
            - Process:: [*]([[Processes]])
                - Document ideas freely as [["N"-notes]]
                - [[literature notes]] or [[verbatim notes]] are representations of the author's ideas.
                    - OK to be verbatim — these should be quick & easy! 
                        - #[[N]] The need for [[originality]] adds [[cognitive burden]].

                - As ideas begin to feel [[evergreen]], a page should be created.
                    - The body of a fleeting note could be made into a page.
                - The [evergreen note template](((DhNyAu1Td))) should be used right away to populate the page.
                    - Populate date created, created by and author right away.
                        - If author is unknown, use the [[Unknown]] tag.

                    - Questions as one of the [[DNP Modules]] and a [[collections]] tag.
                    - `#Q` at the block level to flag individual questions.
                    - As a question [matures]([[maturation]]), it should be transformed into a page. There should be a [Questions template](((HBqwZEBCv))) with `Tags:: #Questions` included. 
                    - A [secondary tag](((IX96gb5b6))) could be implemented to further refine to [[important questions]] or [[zettel questions]].
            - Process::
                - `#Q` at the block level to flag individual questions.

                            - #Q Is this important?
                            - Ability to filter a page by `[[E:]]` to see all [[evergreen notes]] on a page.

                        - The [namespaces]([[namespaces]]) of [[complex page names]] do not collapse.
                            - This leads to inconsistent visual presentation... 
                                - #[[N]] [[evergreen notes]] should be documented with [[simple page names]] — terms within the title that are desired for querying should be included in the `Tags::` block. #Conventions

            - Notes:: #not-populated
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        1. Updated the [global variables](Global Variables) for the week/month
        2. Added [Choice Options](((5JS54DGR5))) smartblock ((For adding an option, and corresponding pros and cons))
        3. Added namespace of `E/` in front of Evergreen notes [*](((u8etVKAtE)))
        4. Added a [random evergreen note](((Qyxu5azax))) smartblock
            - Contacted [[Roamhacker]] to see if the block reference generated could be omitted, leaving only the page. #[[Waiting-[[resolved]]]] #[[Development Requests]]
                - Response:: Can't be omitted. But can be hidden in an [[astrolabe icon]].
                - Here's my workflow in the meantime.
                    - GIF::

        5. Changed `Notes::` to `Contents::` in the [evergreen notes template](((DhNyAu1Td)))
        6. Added a [questions template](((HBqwZEBCv))) & proposed process for managing questions
            - Thoughts on [[questions]] [conventions]([[Conventions]]) #zettelkasten [*]([[Bookmarks]])
        7. Added ["in tension with"](((Lc_lSNDeP))) template.
            - #Q How can we flag and process threats to [[disambiguation]]? ([[i.e.]] overlap or duplication of pages or conventions.)
        8. Deleted a bunch of empty references from the DNP Sections based on the not_populated tag (from the past week)
        9. Making the shift from several questions formats to a **simplified** setup. #Conventions
            - #Questions = [DNP Module Tag]([[DNP Modules]]) and [Collections]([[collections]]) tag
            - #Q = block level tag. 
                - This one should be used at the block level to flag a block as a question. 
            - Notes::
                - The following tags are now retired, with deactivated CSS:
                    - Open Questions
                    - Context Questions
                    - Zettel Questions 
        10. Making the shift from **"Comments"** to **"Conversation"** in the DNP Modules. 
            - `Chat` should be reserved for the top-section for now.
            - `Conversation` as a DNP Module as opposed to Chat + Comments.

            - There is too much overlap right now.
            - Do I use Q, Questions, Open Questions, Context Questions, Zettel Questions?
            - Thoughts:
                - Need something parallel to fleeting, literature, evergreen.
                    - fleeting: 
                        - fully formed questions, designed to be able elicit reflection or discussion. It should be context independent and fully formed.
                        - Suggestion:: `#[[Open Questions]]`
                    - literature:
                        - maybe these could be questions that help to map the outline of a resource — mapping the questions the author is seeking to answer with their writing.
                        - Outline Questions sorta.
                        - Suggestion:: `#[[Context Questions]]` → Don't __love__ this name yet
                    - evergreen
                        - important questions
                        - Well formed and context independent.
                        - These serve as North Stars, helping to orient towards a [clear aim]([[Evergreens/Have a clear aim]]) or purpose.
                        - These research questions guide the work. They frame the search and help to focus efforts and facilitate alignment.
                        - They should be elevated to [[page status]], and should be frequently referenced in related discussions.
                            - #[[N]] [[evergreen notes]] and [[zettel questions]] should be very familiar to group members to facilitate their frequent tagging in related [[resources]], [[ideas]] and [[discussions]].
                                - #[[N]] Not ALL evergreen notes and zettel questions should be on the [[mental fingertips]] of group members — just the ones that are related to central to active pursuits.
                                    - Strategies:
                                        - List on project pages
                                        - Maintain familiarity through the use of [[spaced repetition]]
                                        - Elevate select notes to the tag page as a featured selection or partial index. #Bookmarks

        - However, to efficiently transit it to others, it needs to be more than a page title — you have to flesh it out
        - Brandon and I were discussing structures for Evergreen note pages earlier... #[[evergreen notes]] #Conventions
    - #Conversation 
        1. #[[Chat]]
            - Check this out, [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] [Namespace choice AoT](((u8etVKAtE)))
                - Interested in your thoughts on the use of the Choice Algorithm
                - For any pros/cons I haven't considered, reference the Pros or Cons attribute block of either option. Same for Factors.
                    - Similar convention for within [[About Roam Collective]]
        2. #[[Graph Mentorship]]
            - While making [["N"-notes]], try to make them into full descriptive sentences so that they make more sense in isolation from their original context. I generally use the guidance of [[Evergreens/Evergreen note titles are like APIs]] to apply to fleeting notes. 
The difference is that FNs are a bit more "rough" or less timeless in their content. They may be redundant with other notes, or require some further thinking. That's ok, that's the purpose of the note class.
                - Example:: 
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FIkjY3wRCo4.png?alt=media&token=e844dd85-e65d-4ea4-b690-f469694e1a41)
                    - Note that each FN conveys a complete idea. 
        3. #Replies
            - [This example](((__BAONQ4o))) serves as my supportive argument on [adding a tag which could hide content of css](((LKFDKdVqQ))). Otherwise, if we refer to more than two blocks at the same time, it’s somehow visually annoying.
                - I solve this appearance issue by using [[aliases]]. Does this help? [[~[[leekeifon]]]]
                - The reason I'm hesitant to change the css related to [["N"-notes]] is that the tag is a helpful [visual cue]([[visual cues]]) to trigger the the presence of a zettelkasten idea in various contexts.
            - Don’t know if these are [[fruitful]] new concepts for you. #[[N]] block-level [[model]] and #[[N]] block-embed [[model]] [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]
                - I haven't fully [grokked]([[grok]]) the idea yet — but I think I definitely use a combination of [references]([[block references]]) and [embeds]([[block embeds]]) when making references. 
                    - Factors I use to choose:
                        - Do I want to also display children blocks?
                        - Do I want easy access to editing the content from the reference destination?
            - #[[N]] Learning [[collaboration]] requires separate clear shared [[goals]], to enable the process of learning collaboration to serve as a meta-goal
                - Excellent documentation on this!! 
                    - Maybe consider [appending some relevant tags](should be appended with any relevant tags to the idea. ((to facilitate connections within the zettelkasten))) to the line as well to promote [[resurfacing]].
                        - Id suggest:
                            - collaboration
                            - goals
                - Related:: [[Evergreens/Have a clear aim]]
            - ADDRESSED - Are smartblocks working?  Wasn't able to action it for my daily page
                - I think every person needs to activate the [[roam/js]] block. I'll add that to getting started along with a link to [[About Roam Collective]]. Thanks! 
            - Given how unbounded Roam can be, could it be helpful to present the quick steps as a video?
                - Yup, this would be cool. My video-creating skills are less than fine-tuned so I'll need to figure out how that best looks workflow-wise. 
                - I can record GIFs pretty easily, so I might start tossing them into the mix more often. 
            - Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?
                - I saw this and love the idea! I've used `Rationale::` with similar purpose on occasion... maybe `Basis::`? I see it as an [[Evergreens/beneficial, but optional]] step. 
            - Logged bio and DNT around 9:30AM EST, logging off at 10:45AM EST. LOL jk, logging off at 10:56AM EST
                - I'd place this within a Daily Log module instead. 
                - Change Log is best for changes to the graph and its conventions
                - Perfect! [*](((JZ5RfJLcK)))
                - Better to place it under one's daily notes or within the daily log up above?  
                    - Within your [[DNP Section]] is perfect. The conventions are still kinda emergent for this, but I like how you did it. I see "within your DNP" as a personal log, while pinned to the top as a global log. Central might be better for visibility... will [[sleep on it]].
        4. Turn off brackets to streamline the look of page looks a bit
            - {{[[DONE]]}} Find out how to make this the default in the CSS (I know it's possible, maybe within the [[Leyendecker]] code?) [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] #[[Week-05: 02-01-2021]] [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
        5. #[[N]] [[tagging]] [[conventions]] should lean on using tag combinations as opposed to compound tags #Bookmarks
            - Love this! Great direction. Interested in using this idea to sort out a good system for incorporating [[questions]] throughout the graph.
        6. Allows for seamless inline referencing of Evergreen notes
            - What determines whether you'd reference the page or the block?
            - My gut seems to lean towards referencing the page inline...
                - I generally prefer the [[linked references]] and [[filtering]] associated with [[pages]] over [[blocks]].
        7. Added CSS to eliminate the `#Evergreen` from block references, leaving only the icon
            - This does look nice! 
                - Some reasons for hesitation:
                    - E vs Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes all as active tags feels challenging for [[disambiguation]].
                        - Especially Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes
        8. In the graph, we need to disentangle our approach and conventions versus those we want to share with others in the form of [[graph seed]]s
            - Excellent. This is on my mind as well. 
            - [[[[How To]] Seed Your Graph]]
        9. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I actually proposed this to Matt haha
            - HA! I had a feeling. Excellent. Will do tomorrow likely. 
                - {{[[TODO]]}} Change convention from Comments to Conversation (in alignment with [[[[Roam Book Club]] III]]) [[February 1st, 2021]] [[Brandon Toner]]
        10. Yup  — #Q Is it possible to change [[roam/css]] to differentiate between internal links and external links? 
            - You are THE MAN! [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
        11. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I am too tired to follow [this logic](((DSTTIVhQ3))) right now but it looks cool as hell, bravo! Seems like you've really taken to #[[datalog]]!
            - All the credit goes to [[Dharam]] and [[David Vargas]]! 
            - But yes, cool as hell. Lots of potential with datalog. 
        12. The green color for [distinguish internal and external link](((3ak7VaCMQ))) is good, but for me, it’s kind of confusing me on the semantic for **evergreen**. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]
            - Yea, I thought that might be an issue too... changed back to the orange Matt set it to originally.

            - #[[N]] Learning [[collaboration]] requires separate clear shared [[goals]], to enable the process of learning collaboration to serve as a meta-goal
                - Epistemic status:  strongly held belief, shaped by personal experience managing teams and project managing myself on Roam
                - It's hard to have learning to collaborate be the sole goal, as it's then difficult to measure and assess progress.  How do you think about whether one is collaborating enough?  How does one measure success in the collaboration?
                - It's possible that I'm overly anchored on the one Roam Game that's stated re: project management.  In my own experience incorporating Roam into project management, it took some experimentation by thoughtfully asking myself: is this current workflow enabling me to make progress across my multitude of projects?  It wasn't about the workflow in and of itself, but about how the workflow was a tool towards 
                - My working hypothesis is that given how unbounded and malleable Roam is, the ideal project management structure will likely depend greatly on the type of project (e.g., short vs. long, high collaboration vs. separable).  It will be a family of principles, rather than a universal one.  
            - #[[N]] Building norms for collaboration in a distributed setting might require very structured initiation, that may feel antithetic to Roam
                - Epistemic status:  intuition that needs to be stress-tested
                - Perhaps I'm overly anchored by recency bias from having read Bret Victor's [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) yesterday and the harms of interactivity
                - Within Victor's definition, Roam is clearly a manipulation software and not an information software; but it has an incredible malleability that makes its a multi-purpose tool.  How best to work and shape the tool will depend on the objective.

                    - Epistemic status:  business truism, true to my experience - but need to think about how a digital environment of loosely connected people may lead to a different definition of "effective", "clear", "norms" and "expectations"

        - ADDRESSED - Are smartblocks working?  Wasn't able to action it for my daily page
        - The "About Roam Collective" page feels hidden - I know it's in the sidebar, but I think it would be quite helpful to have it in the recommended path in the steps to getting started
            - I was struck that the help provided a lot of instructions but I had to go looking for what the mission and goals of the Roam Collective were.  
            - In my initial exploration, I stumbled upon the Projects page because I asked myself if there was one.  I would imagine Projects - defining them as a community and deciding which ones to join as an individual - are a foundational step towards building effective collaboration 
        - Given how unbounded Roam can be, could it be helpful to present the quick steps as a video?
        - WOW - so cool: when a reference appeared to the block I wrote above, a message also appeared noting there was an unread reference 
            - Wonder how this works, and how it might work for blocks with multiple authors (although not sure authorship is tracked as blocks are showing up as "anonymous")
                - Seems like all my unread references are showing up, regardless if its a thread I was reading.  Will see how this looks next time I log in
        - Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?

            - Excellent documentation on this!! 
                - Added the recommended tags!!
            - I saw this and love the idea! I've used `Rationale::` with similar purpose on occasion... maybe `Basis::`? I see it as an [[Evergreens/beneficial, but optional]] step. 
                - On an optional basis, for those interested in it, I think it could be interesting to develop some shorthands that help indicate both level of confidence and level of evidence.  At least, I think there could be some interesting experimentation around building collective knowledge that build from individual knowledge basis
            - I'd place this within a Daily Log module instead. 
                - Better to place it under one's daily notes or within the daily log up above?  
                    - Was looking for a polite way to "log off" :) not sure there is a convention for that 
                    - For the specific goal of knowing who is "online" and to facilitate in-roam conversations (such as the one we are having), it could suffice to have a tag to signal that (e.g., "live now" or some other convention).  Then it doesn't have to be up top on the daily note

        - In the graph, we need to disentangle our approach and conventions versus those we want to share with others in the form of [[graph seed]]s
            - In reality, there are a lot of different use cases that require slightly different structures — offering only one version means that we will be missing out on supporting a large number of different communities and graphs

        - Check this out, [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] [Namespace choice AoT](((u8etVKAtE)))
            - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] I like the AOT but disagree with the choice!
                - My stance remains that there are a ton of benefits to having an identifier in the actual page title
                - See my [comments yesterday](((dg-k5f3s6))) for some more thoughts on Evergreen notes
        - #Q How should we disambiguate between the various types of question tags? #Bookmarks [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]
            - My preference is to limit it to a parent-level tag and then a block level tag
                - This would look like
                    - `#Questions`
                        - `#Q` Why is it important to limit the number of tags used in a graph?
                - Benefits
                    - Limits the cognitive burden associated with tagging correctly
                    - Easily extensible
                        - Add an additional tag to add queryable context

                                - #zettelkasten
                                    - #Q How should questions be incorporated in the zettelkasten (e.g., with fleeting, literature, or evergreen notes)
                - Downsides
                    - Context is implicit, not explicit
            - #[[N]] [[tagging]] [[conventions]] should lean on using tag combinations as opposed to compound tags
                - Tag combinations reduce the total number of tags required of the user to remember — easing cognitive burden is helpful during onboarding and can sustain participation
                    - Compound tags almost always have more detailed and specific definitions — not easy to pick up rapidly in a large graph
        - E vs Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes all as active tags feels challenging for [[disambiguation]].
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] makes complete sense — I think we can consolidate it down to be a bit more manageable
                - If I were to build an updated format, this is what it might look like...
                    - [[Evergreens/Evergreen Note example 1]]
        - Thinking of making the switch... thoughts [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]?
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I actually proposed this to Matt haha
                - But yeah I agree — any type of communication, either with reference to a block or not would easily be captured by the `#Converation` block...
        - [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] Check [this](((3u0iEUdbd))) out.

I'm thinking we could adjust the buttons more specifically for out needs.
- TODO (this sprint)

If BLOCKMENTIONS worked with the regular query engine this would be VERY powerful.[*]([[Roam Enhancement Requests]])
            - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I like this SmartBlock a lot
                - Question that immediately jumps to mind is...
                    - #Q What is the value of recreating lists of TODOs on the Daily Note versus pulling from some central repository?
                        - In my head, the central repository could be a set of "dashboards" that help to track both live and completed tasks...
                            - In this way, it's very similar to some of the more established project management tools (e.g., Asana, Trello)
                            - The big difference is being able to tie work in Roam directly to the task and the project...
    - #[[Change Log]]
        - Added CSS to eliminate the `#Evergreen` from block references, leaving only the icon
            - See CSS here: In Block Reference
            - Example: #Evergreens Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims
            - Allows for seamless inline referencing of Evergreen notes
