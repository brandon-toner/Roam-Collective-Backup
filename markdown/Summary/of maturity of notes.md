- Summary — {{word-count}}
    - What is the relationship between complexity and maturity?
        - Think of complexity and maturity as two axes that combine to describe the type and state of any knowledge artefact.
            - See: "#Diagram On Maturity & Complexity"
            - **Maturity** describes the level of refinement of an atomic unit of thought — how developed is the idea?
            - **Complexity** describes the level of an atomic unit of thought — how complex is the idea?

                    - "**Literature Notes** are summaries of what I am reading or other general factoids — they are important to understand by alone don't speak to the novel points or ask the pertinent questions"
                - Permanent
                    - "**Evergreen Notes** are atomic ideas, hopefully novel ones, that I composed based on a foundational of Fleeting and Literature Notes."

    - What are the levels of maturity?
        - There are few "accepted" models for maturity within the knowledge management community.
        - Often communities adopt a [[mythology]] to describe some elements of maturity. Mythology is fluid and can be designed to fit a users of communities preferences.
            - #[[Literature Notes]] [Mythologies]([[mythology]]) are used as a [[mnemoic]] device to boost understanding and retention
        - A few examples of [[mythology]] related to [[maturity]] include:
            - **Gardening** — `seedling` → `budding` → `maturity`
            - **Mining** — `ore` → `iron` → `steel`
            - **Atomic Units** — `atom` → `molecule` → `compound`
        - Regardless of the chosen mythology the goal remains to move ideas from `undeveloped` → `developed`
            - "For instance: `#Ideas` → `#InProgress` → `#Completed`"
    - Why is maturity important?
        - Creating levels of maturity lowers the energy required to put an idea on paper, while creating a forcing function to support further development.
            - "#[[FN]] "Establishing levels within [[evergreen notes]] lowers the bar to creation and raises the bar for [[maturity]]." - [[Charles Farr]][*]([[creativity]])[*]([[minimum requirements]])[*]([[zettelkasten]])"
            - "We are close to nailing the nuance of a [[Evergreens/low floor, high ceiling]] [[zettelkasten]]! #Bookmarks"
            - "The idea of having some levels within evergreen notes lowers the bar for creation but raises the bar for maturity"
                - "In doing so, it can serve as a [[forcing function]] to actually complete high quality permanent notes or zettels[*]([[evergreen notes]])"
        - In the traditional zettelkasten pioneered by Nicolas Luhmann and detailed by Sonke Aherns, the process of writing permanent notes was generally condensed into one sitting. Any additional maturity resulted from the addition of connections or was captured in subsequent notes.

    - How can you implement maturity?
        - Determine important phases (by artifact type)
        - Create processes to support development and to mature notes
- Inception
    - "get the idea down on "paper""
        - "mark it as an "immature" evergreen or some such"
    - "**Fleeting Notes** are those that are very unrefined or tangentially related to a topic I am reading about — they will get processed and eventually be incorporated into more mature original notes..."
- Maturation of Thought
    - "then have a process that forces you to return and mature it... "
        - "In doing so, it can serve as a [[forcing function]] to actually complete high quality permanent notes or zettels[*]([[evergreen notes]])"
- Community Acceptance
    - "#[[FN]] [[maturity]], should consider the **acceptance of a term and claim among the community**, in the context of [[collaboration]]."
        - "Example:: If some terms is used widely by a particular person but his thoughts is not wide spread in the community, then it implicates that the term he/she use is not good enough or he/she didn’t provide enough context for that term. It’s good for personal I usage, but not publicly."
        - "**Therefore**, those true but less acceptance terms are not necessarily turned into a page as soon as it comes up."
