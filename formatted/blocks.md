- "When referencing a [fleeting note](["N"-notes](<"N"-notes.md>)), we’d better assign a property along with it. Concretely speaking, that’s a way to indicate the [relationship]([relationships](<relationships.md>)) between [blocks](<blocks.md>)

## [January 31st, 2021](<January 31st, 2021.md>)
- I generally prefer the [linked references](<linked references.md>) and [filtering](<filtering.md>) associated with [pages](<pages.md>) over [blocks](<blocks.md>).
