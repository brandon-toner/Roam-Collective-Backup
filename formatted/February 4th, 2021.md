            1. I've added mine - Brandon (page ref to 2021 to generate the reference)
            2. Added mine - Peter
        2. **Peter:** "[Everyone](<Everyone.md>) do we have weekly and monthly reviews which can be used as structured ways to force convergence?

        3. **Brandon:** Thoughts on [this](((ROVBmMBrp)))? 
            - Peter: I think I can get by this! Let's try it. You should see author and time by hovering over the dot. I wonder if the time is in your timezone.
            - **Matt V** I like how we can see everyone's conversations here
            - **Larissa** I like this!
            - **[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>):** 10/10 would chat again
            - **leekeifon:** Just wanna point out the key feature of this implementation, that’s in-time chatting and of course, I’m not sure if it’s necessary to forward the communication the future or just let it set at that day.
            - **leekeifon:** But it should be the nice start for synchronous communication, all the contents will be in the air, just like face-to-face talk. You could get your notes down if you want to, but no one is forced to do so.
            - :And actually, I don’t think
        4. **Matt V:** 🚨 FYI I was talking to an engineer with Roam and he told me that block versions are kind of a hack and can sometimes lead to orphaned blocks
            - Like what we are using for CSS? - Brandon
                - **Matt V**: Yes
            - **[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>):** This makes sense — you can actually still block reference from a version even if it's not selected. I bet all it does is "hide" the other versions in some way.
                - For CSS shouldn't be too much of a problem though...
                - **Matt V** Yea that's what's going on and part of the issues is that, currently, the hidden options aren't assigned a parent block so can become detached very easily 
        5. **Brandon:** Why the blue text on *some* shortcuts in the sidebar?
            - **[Image](<Image.md>):** 
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2Fj0rnFxGw2k.png?alt=media&token=7b9dba9e-f7ff-486f-b59d-8e57df402e66)
            - **Matt V:** was an idea of [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]], detailed [here](((To3tG6XRj)))
            - **Peter:** I thought it would attract attentions of new members. Personally I'd click on the big read button if nobody stopped me. Especially if it says welcome and has a smiley face...
            - **Brandon:** Love it! Moved them around a bit, and adjusted the color a tad — really like it. Definitely more attractive for click-through.
        6. **Brandon:** For the top-section chat, let's think up some conventions/norms ((Block ref into your section, as these might get elaborate!))
        7. **Matt V:** I've been asked to give a brief roam tour / overview of some of the workflows and conventions that have been emerging on this and other multiplayer graphs to a group of people mostly only familiar with single player graphs.  
 What does [Everyone](<Everyone.md>) think are the most important workflows/conventions to touch on? [*]([Matthew Vogel](<Matthew Vogel.md>))
            - I'm thinking conventions that are tested and seem to work (even if we are still iterating on them). So far I'm thinking about touching on most of the [Quick Start Guide](<Quick Start Guide.md>), the `@` chat convention, [Daily Activities](<Daily Activities.md>)/[Prompts](<Prompts.md>), and using double parenthesis `(( ))` while writing to search across the graph for adjacent blocks
            - **Peter:** I'd have suggested pretty much what you listened.  The difference between `Chat` and `Conversation` is tackled [here](((ROVBmMBrp)))
        8. **Peter:** roamcollective.org is $10 per year 👀 Output channell?
            - **Brandon:** Ou! Cool idea. Totally. How do we get it set up? [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]
            - **[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>):** I think this is a great idea — I've got a $1 I'm willing to chip in lol
        9. **Brandon:** "Doubting the usefulness of the [Everyone](<Everyone.md>) tag... thoughts?"
            - **Larissa** I like leekeifon's idea of having some tag that triggers a vote/action, imagine that's a similar motivation to an Everyone tag, but doesn't seem like the `[Everyone](<Everyone.md>)` is the right implementation
        10. **Brandon:** Where in the CSS does the query appearance get adjusted? (Not seeing anything references in the change log)
            - **[Image](<Image.md>):**
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FpYoCDth_sJ.png?alt=media&token=0ce5b39b-bd4f-4cbe-bc1a-f706479be55b)
            - **Matt V:** Honestly it doesn't look like any of the [query css](((KOuJf-Smr))) is doing anything...
            - **[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>):** You're got to add a tag to the same block as a query — `[minimal](<minimal.md>)`, `[min-con](<min-con.md>)`, `[min-title](<min-title.md>)`, etc. (check the css for the IDs in the block tags)

                - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] we need to make a decision on what information to keep coming back which to archive and possibly which to delete. Or at least we need to have a conversation about what are our objectives. For examples my management system is still in notion, for now, my weekly pages give me an overview of the important things I wrote/noted in daily pages (e.g. did I stick to my habits, how did I sleep, how happy was I?) Having all of that information in one place you can go through them and decide what is to be forgotten and only found when searched, what needs to be archived, or what needs to be dealt with and when. That works well with tasks, but how do we do something similar?
At the end of a week/month, I feel like fleeting notes should be reorganised in a page forming a conversation which might lead the following week to some permanent notes. [~[[Larissa de Lima](<~[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]] [cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]]

    - #[Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>)
        - Our [communication](<communication.md>) mechanism right now, using `@/cc`, is emulating mail system, which is implicitly [asynchronous](<asynchronous.md>).
        - I personally love mailing, which is a good balance between slow and fast thinking, especially when I’m having question to solve.
        - in-time chat vs mail-based chat is one typical implementation on [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) [communication](<communication.md>).
        - Actually, is [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) actually a subjective definition?
        - Our current [communication](<communication.md>) [conventions](<conventions.md>) feels like a mix of in-time chat and mail-based chat.
        - If I consider face-to-face chatting is truly [synchronous](<synchronous.md>), compared with other [communication](<communication.md>) method, then I could think of some differences as shown below ... 
            - enables [divergence](<divergence.md>) easily.
                - Assumption: everyone’s mind is reasonable.
                - Under [this assumption](((5SJKfkOSd))), in the situation that our communication topic jump from one to another, there must a way to reason about such transformation.
                    - the input for the transformation is mostly(?) related to states, which can be outside-world state(e.g. touch, voice, etc.) and/or inner-world state(one’s own thinking)
                    - #[P:Self](<P:Self.md>) normally, when we’re in the context of [communication](<communication.md>), the content of communication itself has high priority in our thought, but when the content isn’t interesting me, its priority decreases and my own thoughts(not much related to current topic, even not related to the whole conversation) floats up and I may suddenly change the topic. And sometimes, other will feels weird.
                    - #[P:Self](<P:Self.md>) Sometimes, something clicked in my mind, but it’s off context of the whole communication, and I can’t help saying that thoughts out and other will also feel weird.
                - When we’re talking face-to-face, we share much more states than pure words communication. AND, every shared state is the potential link to another topic, meaning that we have much more broader choices on topics, and therefore, much more possible for a [divergent](<divergent.md>) [communication](<communication.md>).
                - #[P:Self](<P:Self.md>) Sadly speaking, this may be the core reason why I don’t like casual phone call, seems that i don’t have much ‘hooks’ to do fast association with pure voice when the content itself has not much structure(even with my previous girl friend...). Kind of weird, man...
        - #[Q](<Q.md>) It should be possible to differentiate [these structure](((fQ5H_Edl8))) by [datalog](<datalog.md>) query. But I would like a discussion on the semantics of these structures. In other words, **why we want to distinguish these two types of structure when we’re writing**? It has certain [patterns](<patterns.md>) to be recognized.  [cc:[[Brandon Toner](<cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [cc:[[Matthew Vogel](<cc:[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]]
            - **[Related](<Related.md>):** sibling query feature request mentioned by [Joel Chan](<Joel Chan.md>) and [Robert Haisfield](<Robert Haisfield.md>) in their chatting video.
            - **[Related](<Related.md>):** The above block is the example of "#[FN](<FN.md>) block-embed [model](<model.md>)"
        - Actually, tooltip is a great entry point for conveying [conventions](<conventions.md>) on "#[FN](<FN.md>) block-level [model](<model.md>)" and "#[FN](<FN.md>) block-embed [model](<model.md>)".
        - #[Q](<Q.md>) What’s the best way to convey information within a block?
            - **[Observations](<Observations.md>):** one [tensions](<tensions.md>) is, when the linking intention and the center of block information don’t align.
            - #[FN](<FN.md>) Those css that are not trying to convey the center of block information, tends to dull our concentration.
                - **[[ ] Examples](<[ ] Examples.md>):** convey what I think is good and what’s not.
        - "Assumption: everyone’s mind is reasonable."
            - concretely speaking, there should be a logical chain behind what we said, implicitly or explicitly. And we may be able to trace along the logical chain   and that’s what I mean ‘reasonable’.
        - #[I](<I.md>) Technically speaking, I think it’s possible to write a `roam/js` plugin ((not rely on browser setting)) for community members to render their own private style. Am I wrong?

            - Seems that we have no way to ignore it automatically(i.e. by query) after we read the message with `Everyone` tag, not like current communication mechanism.
            - One way to think of it, is to consider it as a [Roam collective personal publish protocol](((Mfh93O_VB))), that gives each community member the power to establish their own channel.

            - They are SO CLOSE to working, but they don't "deactivate" when you toggle to a new dropdown option... all options would be "active" all the time. This messes up the linked refs.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FzFv0FFB1AR.gif?alt=media&token=60d1a05e-af7b-4714-b7eb-3867e53a6af6)
        5. On [monthly reviews](((b5_pXqQgk)))[*]([@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]])
            - Yea, this is a great discussion for a sync-meeting.
            - No immediate solutions come to mind, but if you have some ideas, it might jog some ideas for me too.

            - [@[[Zsolt Viczián](<@[[Zsolt Viczián.md>)]] has put together several smartblock templates that will run a datalog query and display it in a nice way. It's great work and an exceptionally good article but in my opinion actually pollutes the graph with `:hiccup` blocks. The better way would probably be to use [roam/render](<roam/render.md>) custom components. [cc:[[Brandon Toner](<cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] here's another rabbit hole of customization to fall down :P Right now the smartblock solution feels very much like a ["Hacked" solution]([Evergreens/"Hacked" solutions are likely to break over time.](<Evergreens/"Hacked" solutions are likely to break over time..md>)) with custom components being more ["native"]([Evergreens/Use the native convention as much as possible.](<Evergreens/Use the native convention as much as possible..md>))
                - You can get his smartblocks [here](https://zsviczian.github.io/DatomicQuery.zip) but be warned they're very complicated.  Nothing like the simple system you've imagined.
        - [Feature Request](<Feature Request.md>) I would kill for a way to filter out code blocks from search results
        - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((((0nxSPSAyD))))}}
            - I'm struggling with this on my personal graph as well. There needs to be a stronger connection between root level color options and where those colors are actually used
                - "**Matt V:** 🚨 FYI I was talking to an engineer with Roam and he told me that block versions are kind of a hack and can sometimes lead to orphaned blocks"
    - [Questions](<Questions.md>) ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) 
        - How do you [query](<query.md>)? for blocks that contain 2 tags and not for when one is a child of the other
            - i.e. look for this 
                - [tag1](<tag1.md>) [tag2](<tag2.md>)
            - Not this
                - [tag1](<tag1.md>)
                    - [tag2](<tag2.md>)
    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>) 
        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Short answer, no. Namespaces aren't expressed in CSS, they're interpreted by Roam's internal parser. The only way I know of changing the namespace is through user prefs.[*](((uAKl3yKFe)))
            - I uses namespaces extensively in my personal graph since I know they'll be useful in the future but at this moment in Roam they're cosmetic. You can't query for them without [datalog](<datalog.md>) . Right now it feels like page references in the page name work alright but I often end up duplicating the page reference under a [Tags](<Tags.md>) attribute so who knows lol 
        - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] what benefit do you see for filtering a page using [OR](<OR.md>) instead of constructing a regular [query](<query.md>) ? 
`{{[query](<query.md>): {or: [ex-B](<ex-B.md>) [ex-C](<ex-C.md>)}}}`
            - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] have you tried the [query builder](((OIrYB9b3N))) script? You're right, it's still not as simple as a page filter but it brings the complexity of creating a query WAY down [*](((j2oZoVpHO)))
        - [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]] [*](((zM6l437S8))) Yes there is! [Check it out.](((hupwRjd9n))) This should follow each page even if the order is changed. I tried to keep the color subtle so it's not too aggressive [cc:[[Brandon Toner](<cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] did some more tweaking of CSS, interested in your thoughts. We may be getting into overload territory with to many tweaks from vanilla for new users [*](((uiP-kSPjh)))
    - #[Change Log](<Change Log.md>)
        - [Added CSS](((dQZ2rE2un))) to prevent the right sidebar page title from jumping around when editing the title
        - [Added left sidebar CSS](((hupwRjd9n))) to highlight important pages [*](((zM6l437S8)))
        - [Boosted the visibility of the main page multibar to prevent accidental clicks](((qmCSlYDo9)))
    - [Feedback](<Feedback.md>)
        - I'm loving the energy and iteration on this graph but I am a little concerned about how many features and conventions we want to add before they become more of a hindrance than a help to new graph users.
            - The more separate and different conventions we have for chat (just for example) the more likely they are going to be misused

            - [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]] I like this [idea](((nZArzolvZ))) — [~[[Larissa de Lima](<~[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]] had started to concatenate a but of questions together. Maybe worthwhile to create a grouped list of all of the scratchpad and conversation topics from the past week.
                - Let's get started on this here: [Weekly Review: Graph Seed — February 4, 2020](<Weekly Review: Graph Seed — February 4, 2020.md>)
                    - Will #[Follow Up](<Follow Up.md>) here tomorrow and start working on it a bit...
                - Also, l love the idea of making it a [synchronous](<synchronous.md>) activity — let's all hop on Zoom or Clubhouse soon.
        - On Broadcasting to the Graph/Group
            - Regarding the idea of an [Everyone](((yT8htOsew))) tag, I think there's an important function of [broadcasting](<broadcasting.md>) to the entire community that we need to consider — cc: [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [@[[leekeifon](<@[[leekeifon.md>)]] [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]] [~[[Larissa de Lima](<~[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]]
                - What about some flag `[Broadcast](<Broadcast.md>) / [Radio](<Radio.md>) / [Vote](<Vote.md>)` that when combined with a date will automatically get populated to a top-level section?
                    - Essentially we would just write a SmartBlock that would surface all blocks with a combination of  `[Broadcast](<Broadcast.md>) / [Radio](<Radio.md>) / [Vote](<Vote.md>)` + a `DNP: [February 4th, 2021](<February 4th, 2021.md>)` tag
                        - We would need to add some status flags — i.e., `[Settled](<Settled.md>) / [Accepted](<Accepted.md>) / [Rejected](<Rejected.md>)` to signify that the SmartBlock can drop it
                - Proposed Function (draft)
                    - `[42SmartBlock](<42SmartBlock.md>)` Community Input
                        - <%BLOCKMENTIONSDATED:10,Radio,<%DATE:7 days ago%>,<%DATE:in 7 days%>,-Accepted,-Rejected,-Settled%>

            - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I started using an attribute — I hope I don't come to [regret](((xaNyqoEJT))) it lol
            - [~[[leekeifon](<~[[leekeifon.md>)]] I agree — love a [good email](((Ay1XRIeu-))) conversation!
                - I want to set up an urbit community that automatically exports the daily IRC chat to the graph...
