            - **Brandon:** Love it! Moved them around a bit, and adjusted the color a tad — really like it. Definitely more attractive for click-through.
        6. **Brandon:** For the top-section chat, let's think up some conventions/norms ((Block ref into your section, as these might get elaborate!))
        7. **Matt V:** I've been asked to give a brief roam tour / overview of some of the workflows and conventions that have been emerging on this and other multiplayer graphs to a group of people mostly only familiar with single player graphs.  
 What does [Everyone](<Everyone.md>) think are the most important workflows/conventions to touch on? [*]([Matthew Vogel](<Matthew Vogel.md>))
            - I'm thinking conventions that are tested and seem to work (even if we are still iterating on them). So far I'm thinking about touching on most of the [Quick Start Guide](<Quick Start Guide.md>), the `@` chat convention, [Daily Activities](<Daily Activities.md>)/[Prompts](<Prompts.md>), and using double parenthesis `(( ))` while writing to search across the graph for adjacent blocks
            - **Peter:** I'd have suggested pretty much what you listened.  The difference between `Chat` and `Conversation` is tackled [here](((ROVBmMBrp)))

                - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] we need to make a decision on what information to keep coming back which to archive and possibly which to delete. Or at least we need to have a conversation about what are our objectives. For examples my management system is still in notion, for now, my weekly pages give me an overview of the important things I wrote/noted in daily pages (e.g. did I stick to my habits, how did I sleep, how happy was I?) Having all of that information in one place you can go through them and decide what is to be forgotten and only found when searched, what needs to be archived, or what needs to be dealt with and when. That works well with tasks, but how do we do something similar?
At the end of a week/month, I feel like fleeting notes should be reorganised in a page forming a conversation which might lead the following week to some permanent notes. [cc:[[Larissa de Lima](<cc:[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]] [cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]]

        - Our [communication](<communication.md>) mechanism right now, using `@/cc`, is emulating mail system, which is implicitly [asynchronous](<asynchronous.md>).
        - I personally love mailing, which is a good balance between slow and fast thinking, especially when I’m having question to solve.
        - in-time chat vs mail-based chat is one typical implementation on [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) [communication](<communication.md>).
        - Actually, is [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) actually a subjective definition?
        - Our current [communication](<communication.md>) [conventions](<conventions.md>) feels like a mix of in-time chat and mail-based chat.
        - If I consider face-to-face chatting is truly [synchronous](<synchronous.md>), compared with other [communication](<communication.md>) method, then I could think of some differences as shown below ... 
            - enables [divergence](<divergence.md>) easily.
                - Assumption: everyone’s mind is reasonable.
                - Under [this assumption](((5SJKfkOSd))), in the situation that our communication topic jump from one to another, there must a way to reason about such transformation.
                    - the input for the transformation is mostly(?) related to states, which can be outside-world state(e.g. touch, voice, etc.) and/or inner-world state(one’s own thinking)
                    - #[P:Self](<P:Self.md>) normally, when we’re in the context of [communication](<communication.md>), the content of communication itself has high priority in our thought, but when the content isn’t interesting me, its priority decreases and my own thoughts(not much related to current topic, even not related to the whole conversation) floats up and I may suddenly change the topic. And sometimes, other will feels weird.
                    - #[P:Self](<P:Self.md>) Sometimes, something clicked in my mind, but it’s off context of the whole communication, and I can’t help saying that thoughts out and other will also feel weird.
                - When we’re talking face-to-face, we share much more states than pure words communication. AND, every shared state is the potential link to another topic, meaning that we have much more broader choices on topics, and therefore, much more possible for a [divergent](<divergent.md>) [communication](<communication.md>).
                - #[P:Self](<P:Self.md>) Sadly speaking, this may be the core reason why I don’t like casual phone call, seems that i don’t have much ‘hooks’ to do fast association with pure voice when the content itself has not much structure(even with my previous girl friend...). Kind of weird, man...
        - #[Q](<Q.md>) It should be possible to differentiate [these structure](((eIy6LyXQa))) by [datalog](<datalog.md>) query. But I would like a discussion on the semantics of these structures.

            - [@[[Zsolt Viczián](<@[[Zsolt Viczián.md>)]] has put together several smartblock templates that will run a datalog query and display it in a nice way. It's great work and an exceptionally good article but in my opinion actually pollutes the graph with `:hiccup` blocks. The better way would probably be to use [roam/render](<roam/render.md>) custom components. [cc:[[Brandon Toner](<cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] here's another rabbit hole of customization to fall down :P Right now the smartblock solution feels very much like a ["Hacked" solution]([[[E:](<[[E:.md>) "Hacked" solutions are likely to break over time.]]) with custom components being more ["native"]([[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Use the native convention as much as possible.]])

            - I uses namespaces extensively in my personal graph since I know they'll be useful in the future but at this moment in Roam they're cosmetic.
