                - Show a google earth type map to see where every graph is, on the globe
                - Haven't understood all the specifics of how it works, but might be possible to highlight areas of high activity in the graph
                    - I know you can see which pages have the biggest word count, but not sure if you can see which page (or even block) __references__ (a block with `[Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)](<Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies).md>)` and it's children for ex.) have the biggest word count.
                    - Would be interesting to see which blocks are referenced the most
                        - First results would be the DNP tags obviously, but what comes after is interesting.
                - In the rbc demo, I remember being surprised that it had access to much more data than I thought it could. **There's potential here to resurface relevant things**, but that depends on specifics of what it can do, and heavily depends on graph conventions too.
