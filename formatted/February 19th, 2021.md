            - demos, even if totally faked, that show powerful use cases, could get rewards, inspire the roam team, and inspire developers to build
            - You could search through feeds
                - db that collects public feeds. Search db name, then search for a keyword
                - would be facilitated if we had standard conventions
            - if block-level tagging conventions were followed in everyone's notes about stuff, you could query critical questions, tangents about a link you put in
        - thoughts on [call with stian](((i4Nep2zgV)))
            - UID thing is powerful
                - If you and a friend receive the same public feed (new submissions to roamgames for ex, or a newsletter), you could block reference it in a private feed with your friend, and it would link correctly on both graphs.
                    - Commenting/referencing blocks from public feeds in a chat with someone, all from within your database!
            - "demos, even if totally faked, that show powerful use cases, could get rewards, inspire the roam team, and inspire developers to build"
                - It's still gonna be some time till they develop the infrastructure and features to make that happen, so the most important thing now is not to make it work, but to figure out how we would do things across databases, what it can be used for, how the UI could look like, etc
                    - and the best way to do so is by making throroughly thought-out demos of how things could be, even if simulated.
                    - We could just re-create a lot of apps in roam, but we have an opportunity here to question existing apps and create better solutions that don't repeat their flaws.
            - Related to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/samuelbars/status/1361669347513614336?s=20), UIs could be decoupled from the normal roam UI
                - #[N](<N.md>) The normal roam UI is just a powerful system of free hierarchies
                - UIs for specific use cases could have reduced functionality and have special extensions activated (unique css and js features), and they would use the [normal roam graph and UI](((ZmC71tQ_R))) as a storage system.
                    - Trying to articulate this clearly.
                    - Blocks can inputed in a certain UI, but then manipulated, referenced and re-used in other tasks you do in the usual UI
                        - For example, chat is like slack or whatever, but then you can reference messages in your fleeting notes and stuff like this
                        - You could have a "therapy" app with content and writing prompts (like the excellent Intellect app on android), in a calming / feature-light UI.
                            - Different UIs induce different modes of attention
                            - Reflection/introspection by going over previous journaling sessions, seeing patterns with block refs, etc, could be done at another time, with the full-blow roam features

            - [@Charles]([~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) "[@Samuel]([~[[Samuel Bars](<~[[Samuel Bars.md>)]]) [re](((CAMjHNUyO))) are you all reading the book in tandem with the writing prompts?"
                - The writing prompts are not linked to progress on the book, seems a bit non-linear
                    - I read a few chapters, skimmed a bit part of it, but yeah I've been slacking a bit 
                - There are group readings at 3:30am on mondays, so I didn't join, and I forgot about checking the other group that popped up for accessible timezones
        - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) about [tweeting thoughts about the graph](((IYSIt3usl)))
            - Would be cool if we could share some interesting lines of thought/conversation from the discussions here.
                - What do you think about integrating the plugin to send tweets from the db?
                    - Conventions could be
                        - Tweet things from your dnp only, but you can integrate block refs
                        - Make a second version of the block and children you wanna tweet, format so that it works with the plugin and add links (QT and else)/gifs/image.
                        - Then click send, and go back to original version so the linking and hierarchy keeps respecting graph conventions (so that queries and all that keep working)
        - [@B]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) about [scaling adoption of RC conventions](((ct3Iw8fLY)))
            - Seems like https://roamlab.org/ from [Kyle Stratis](<Kyle Stratis.md>) is also going to experiment with conventions, and maybe stumble on different ones? What's your take, thoughts, on this?
                - It's possible that other projects emerge with people sharing a bunch of conventions different to the ones in RC. This can complicate future inter-graph sharing
        - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) & [@Charles]([~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) on [this](((4jsJ-Oqrk))) and [this](((XUr-8JBw_)))
            - I agree with you two on this, I enjoy the use of block-level tags to articulate/define your thought process.
                - For example the questions are really good. Getting into the practice of turning issues/ideas into questions makes it much more inviting for others to give another answer/perspective.

            - [I](<I.md>) Create an demo chat interface to demonstrate how native chat in roam could function
                - Could exist within a side bar or elsewhere
                - Each chat would be registered with a member page, e.g., `Chat/[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)`
                - Chat would live in an archive page `[roam/chat](<roam/chat.md>)`

                    - There are other ways this could be organized
                - Pros
                    - Easy, real time communication ‚Äî archived within the graph
                    - Foundation as blocks allows for easy use of block references in chat (aliased or not)
                    - Preservation as blocks allows for easy referencing for chat blocks elsewhere in the graph (such as in scratchpad)
                    - Could easily integrate with "[I](<I.md>) JavaScript plugin to assist with in-graph communication ‚Äî access to all member mention pages using some simple trigger ‚Äî e.g., `@@`"

            - {{character-count}}
                - For Roam Games 3, Roam Collective has built The Roaman Agora, a public graph to aggregate information on submissions and related projects, in addition to fostering discussion around these submissions.

You can view the Agora and sign up for access here!

https://roamresearch.com/#/app/The-Roaman-Agora/page/7-iN8IzpA
            - {{character-count}}
                - The Agora comes out of Roam Collective's experimentation with a multiplayer Roam environment over the past month or so.

In the process, we've coalesced around a few conventions that support really fruitful in-graph conversation and discussion.
            - {{character-count}}
                - On of the biggest [takeaways](<takeaways.md>) is that in-graph conversation is a hugely powerful mechanism for generating divergence and subsequent convergence. So much so that we want to foster it more broadly!
            - {{character-count}}
                - Brandon summarized RC's progress here...
https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1362956670976946179?s=20
            - {{character-count}}
                - So our submission for Roam Games III is the Roaman Agora, a public graph designed to:

1) Collate Roam Games submissions, tracking dependencies and influence...
2) Foster further conversation and discussion around the submissions...
3) Harness the resulting feedback loop...
            - {{character-count}}
                - Collecting submissions in a single graph allows for easier tracking of dependencies, a core focus for RGIII.

It also enables discussions that span and tie together disparate submissions, projects, and contributors. Ultimately, this is what we're most excited about.
            - {{character-count}}
                - These broad discussion create a positive feedback loop. As new ideas and questions emerge, the community can grapple with them, and the resulting insights feeds back into development of new Roam capabilities (conventions, tools, use-cases...), as well as new questions & ideas.
            - {{character-count}}
                - Through this cycle, we hope these in-graph conversations influence future Roam Game submissions and projects. With submissions ~generally~ centralized, dependency tracking emerges naturally...
            - {{character-count}}
                - Right now, the Agora is in its MVP state. Most of the conventions are manual to a degree, but we are excited for it to expand in a variety of ways...
            - {{character-count}}
                - The most exciting is integrating @houshuang's roam-inter. Doing so would allow for submitters (and other project owners) to push updates to the Agora. Similarly, the Agora could publish key questions & updates for subscribers to grapple with in their own graphs.
            - {{character-count}}
                - The Roam Collective team has a bunch of other topics we are planning to pursue ‚Äî better communication tools, shared zettelkastens, asynchronous & distributed project management.

Some of which will inevitably make its way to the Agora.
            - {{character-count}}
                - Additionally, as part of Roam Collective's submission for RGIII, we plan to package the conventions, CSS, and the FAQs that underpin the Agora into a "seedpack" for easy reuse in other graphs.

The hope is it lowers the bar for other communities to stand up their own multiplayer graphs.
