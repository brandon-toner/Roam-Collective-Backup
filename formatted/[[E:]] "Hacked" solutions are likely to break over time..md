        - Hacked solutions are usually out-of-sync with [native conventions]([[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Use the native convention as much as possible.]]), employing workarounds to accomplish an extension in [functionality](<functionality.md>).
        - Benefits of hacked solutions:
            - Help to improve functionality (at least short term)
            - Can cast a compelling vision that may influence the development of the core product team. 
        - Risk of hacked solutions:
            - Instability.
            - Future updates may render the hack unusable.
