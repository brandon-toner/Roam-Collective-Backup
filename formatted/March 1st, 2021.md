                - Ability to "go off on a tangent" at any time, without taking the conversation off the rails.

                - Yea I 100% agree. In seeing the initial activity, I've been super anxious thinking of all of the missed potential. A graph would help to bring a stronger perspective across time -- saving ideas and improving serendipities.
                - "[^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [re](((u3WYIwaTM))) ‚Äî I completely agree. The one thing I will say is the [velocity of conversation](<velocity of conversation.md>) is much higher in slack, which is important when you have more people together. This is part of the reason why I'm interested in building a in-graph chat extension for Roam."
                    - Yea, velocity is good. But not great if it's too lossy. I'd say that fast and lossy is much worse for driving progress, outcomes and clarity than slower graph communication.
                    - The value of the graph is that things are **organized** as they are communicated. It bundles those steps -- driving the compounding of ideas across time.
                    - But yea, agree. If we can find ways to make the graph experience more nimble and quick, then that would be a huge advancement. 
                        - Not sure if in-graph chat is the answer though... unless it is effectively tied to documentation conventions. 
                        - If separate and fleeting, Slack can still play that role.  
                        - Interested in hearing more details about your vision for in-graph chat. It's yet to "click" for me haha.
                - "However, these conventions are slow. Instead of an immediate chat, I believe that they are more like writing a letter (snail-mail) or an email. There is great value in this approach, but it does fall short for other types of communication."
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) Are RC conventions actually slower than other chat options?
                        - Less convenient, yes (mobile, push notifications, etc) -- but I'm not quite convinced on slower.
                            - I think the effect of "slower" might be more related to **notifications** & **getting in-and-out of Roam** vs actual convention speed.
                - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] to your point [here](((JQod1Yt80))), I agree that this method is much stronger. However, the ideas I was building off of were widely shared in a chat form, and then expanded upon.

                    - Maybe we could simply offer the RC graph as a conversational space in addition to the Slack channel. 
                    - Hosting conversation here (as opposed to another new graph) would also help rest my tension around [community fragmentation](((UPtrVlc29))).

            - There is still a fair bit of work to be done to mature and implement the agile framework in RC, but this is something I'm keen to see happen. 
            - The problem is, I am very loose and exploratory in my development style haha ‚Äî so I'm until I catch a wave of clarity on this, I'm not super likely to push it forward. 
            - Part of what is holding me back currently is likely the lack of clarity on overall direction/roadmap. 
            - I'm sort waiting for the epics to form naturally rather than forcing their development... but who knows ‚Äî they might emerge sooner.

                - Projects have statuses (on hold, in progress, completed, dropped, someday|maybe) ‚Äî and these projects can easily be linked to one or several epics.
                    - An epic is comprised of multiple projects. 
                    - Sprints help to converge group attention and efforts to one or more projects as dictated by group priorities, interests and timelines.

        - Thoughts on [in-graph chat](<in-graph chat.md>), in-graph snail-mail, and the idea of [velocity of conversation](<velocity of conversation.md>)
            - In [Books/The Culture Code](<Books/The Culture Code.md>) author [Dan Coyle](<Dan Coyle.md>) mentions that one way to understand the strength of a community is to evaluate the [velocity of learning](<velocity of learning.md>). Communities with a high velocity of learning are generally stronger.
            - In our experience here, conversation and discussion is a real driver of thought, refinement, and synthesis. I would say that strong conversation (and thinking in public) really accelerates the [velocity of learning](<velocity of learning.md>) (both individually and as a community).
                - [FN](<FN.md>) The [velocity of conversation](<velocity of conversation.md>) within a community is strongly correlated with the [velocity of learning](<velocity of learning.md>)
            - However, the nature of our communication is the [energy required]([activation energy](<activation energy.md>)) is higher than other forms communication, such as Slack.
                - As [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) rightly [points out](((iexsCPofn))), the fact that communication is slower forces us as a community to better structure what we're sharing, aiding with overall synthesis. I believe that the conventions of the `[Conversation](<Conversation.md>)` section are very effective at doing this.
                    - However, these conventions are slow. Instead of an immediate chat, I believe that they are more like writing a letter (snail-mail) or an email. There is great value in this approach, but it does fall short for other types of communication.
            - So, I would propose a second channel for communication ‚Äî an [in-graph chat](<in-graph chat.md>) function.
                - This would allow for rapid communication, which is ideal for certain type of communication.
                - Asking for someone's opinion on an update to the CSS or if they want to find time time connect this week on a specific project are good example of communication that is fleeting and is appropriate for a chat.
                    - See: "[@[[Samuel Bars](<@[[Samuel Bars.md>)]] do you want to connect on prototyping a [chat](((Xj3_JaYIm))) function sometime this week?"
                - I also believe that this could lower the bar for broader participation, especially in mid-stream (per [Mark's](((m6u2SPGWP))) question).
                    - Imagine you join the RC graph here after a bit and can ping the chat asking what you should review. It would be possible to get near instantaneous feedback on where to jump in.
            - I think most importantly with the idea of [in-graph chat](<in-graph chat.md>) is that it lives completely within roam.
                - Each chat would be tagged with an author and a time
                    - 12:12 [Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>): This is an example chat
                - Chats would be stored in a single location
                    - [roam/chat](<roam/chat.md>)
                - Chats would be nested underneath a date

                        - "12:12 [Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>): This is an example chat"
                - You could include page references and block references within a chat
                    - 12:13 [Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>): Hey all, can you take a look at my thoughts here: "Thoughts on [in-graph chat](<in-graph chat.md>), in-graph snail-mail, and the idea of [velocity of conversation](<velocity of conversation.md>)"
                    - 12:14 [Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>): Much of what I'm writing about is related to [Books/The Culture Code](<Books/The Culture Code.md>)...
            - Ultimately, I think adding this type of communication would be supplemental to the conventions we have now rather than acting as a replacement.

        - On Chat with Brandon & Mark
            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [re](((u3WYIwaTM))) ‚Äî I completely agree. The one thing I will say is the [velocity of conversation](<velocity of conversation.md>) is much higher in slack, which is important when you have more people together. This is part of the reason why I'm interested in building a in-graph chat extension for Roam.
                - See: "[I](<I.md>) Create an demo chat interface to demonstrate how native chat in roam could function"
            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] you make a [good point](((QmZ-dy0U3))) about what is essentially just technical barriers at current. Regardless, I think communicating using block references will always be slower than communicating in a chat thought.
                - I think a big reason why isn't actually the technical capabilities, but the view and layout of the communication. In a chat all you have to do is look up or scroll up, where our current conventions require you to have multiple blocks open.
                - Now, another thing I would love would be some way to toggle visualizations that would essentially thread multiple conversation blocks together. Similar to clicking the references box, but more conversation oriented...
            - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] to your point [here](((JQod1Yt80))), I agree that this method is much stronger. However, the ideas I was building off of were widely shared in a chat form, and then expanded upon. I don't think people's approach to chat is going to change, so it would be worthwhile to bring it into a graph so anyone could then thread off of it!
            - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]] regarding [my thoughts](((suZ32Mrpd))), I was thinking something more along the lines of the below...
                - **[Image](<Image.md>):**
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FbpryAU5RPE.png?alt=media&token=649e13d3-7a94-41a4-b8a6-17312dbfe640)
                - The components & process underpinning of the above are...
                    - The [Chatroom](<Chatroom.md>), which would be an embedded chat, allowing users to easily type into the bar.
                        - This window would write into the [roam/chat](<roam/chat.md>) page, which would essentially serve as a repository of the chat's history
                            - The benefits here are numerous...
                                - Chats can use roams page reference and block reference functions, as the foundation is a block within the [roam/chat](<roam/chat.md>) page
                                - Graph users could go into block reference a chat block, to thread conversation (either within the Chatroom or on their own conversation page)
                                - Eliminates the split between some IRC chatroom and the graph where work is done...
                - In theory, you could have multiple chats going under different namespaces, such as `roam/chat/Roam Think Tank` or `roam/chat/General Chat`, which would be accessible through `Chatroom/Roam Think Tank` and `Chatroom/General Chat`
                - Ultimately, this would provide most of the benefits of slack or discord without ever leaving the graph... The other upside is the ability to use native roam features within chat, and to use block-references to thread off of chat (either as a conversation or as input into other notes).
                - My intuition is this is technically possible within roam ‚Äî perhaps some [render](<render.md>) object could be used to create the Chatrooms?
        - Simple Replies
            - [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]] [re](((u9YdnOIa6))) ‚Äî my thesis on [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) and generally working and thinking at the [block-level](<block-level.md>) is that doing so is more powerful than working at the page level, because you have direct access to the content.
                - It's a rough theory and I'm interrogating why I believe it. I want to be able to articulate it well, where right now it's really just something that I __feel__.
                - **[Related](<Related.md>):**
                    - [cc:[[Joel Chan](<cc:[[Joel Chan.md>)]]'s thread here is using different language but I believe working on a similar thesis...
                        - https://twitter.com/JoelChan86/status/1365352979331747845?s=20
            - [@[[Samuel Bars](<@[[Samuel Bars.md>)]] do you want to connect on prototyping a [chat](((Xj3_JaYIm))) function sometime this week?
                - Really interested in getting a physical demo / artifact spun up to share the idea and start generating some feedback on it...
                - Check out my thoughts [here](((9SJh9UAcx))) ‚Äî pulled together a janky mockup in figma
            - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [re: meta namespaces](((X_gthxLfx))) ‚Äî I like RC. In the Agora I used `Graph/` to do the same. Definitely helps to disentangle versus more general [conversation](<conversation.md>) tags...
        - [Clubhouse](<Clubhouse.md>) chat with [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)
            - [maxims](<maxims.md>) are similar to [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) in many ways; similar with [catch phrases](<catch phrases.md>), [principles](<principles.md>), etc.
                - easily digestable
                - can build and stack
                - can see where they converge
                - don't need to compete for space, there are a number ways to say the same thing
            - A [directive](<directive.md>)/[maxims](<maxims.md>)/[principles](<principles.md>) is a [claim](<claim.md>) in practice
                - is there a difference here between active and passive?
            - A synthesis note is a mature version of a claim; a maxim is a application of a claim (wisdom centric versus statement of fact centric)
            - maxims and synthesis notes make up the universe of evergreen notes
            - Levels
                - claim (statement of fact) & maxim (application of findings)
                - observations
                - proposition
            - "the most developed approach will be spectrum based"
    - [Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)
        - [ ] Review Brandon's thoughts on maxims
        - "I agree with these two points strongly. "

            - "I think the effect of "slower" might be more related to **notifications** & **getting in-and-out of Roam** vs actual convention speed."
            - "I think a big reason why isn't actually the technical capabilities, but the view and layout of the communication. In a chat all you have to do is look up or scroll up, where our current conventions require you to have multiple blocks open."
                - I agree with these two points strongly. 
                - But I would disagree with the [latter](((ggdiG2UMw))) at some fundamental level in that conventions could be mediated in the short-term and shaped in the long-term to provide the thread experience. 
                    - More testing would be necessary to work out the intricacies, [but look at this screenshot](((oQnsl-Asr)))

                - [My intuition](((ZYBIgpKx8))), likely not better than yours is absolutely possible. Perhaps even in JS, but definitely in [roam/render](<roam/render.md>). 
                - I take it you shared this with [Stian H√•klev](<Stian H√•klev.md>) already [Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)?
        - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] and [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]] - I think the [Projects/Develop Shared Graph for Roam Think Tank](<Projects/Develop Shared Graph for Roam Think Tank.md>) is calling for your expertise!

        - In typical [agile development](<agile development.md>) there is stories which are allocated to an epic.

What is a good way to track the progress of a story between TODO, DOING, DONE. That is captured across sprints on the same and different epics.
            - [Q](<Q.md>) How can we visualise/model the completion of progress made on stories in relation to a sprint but also globally across sprints and epics?

                - how do we visualise story dependencies?
                - When a story is blocked by something. How do we visualise that such that it shows up when looking at a story that depends on it?
