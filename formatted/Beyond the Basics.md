    - Using the other [DNP Modules](<DNP Modules.md>).
        - **Have a look at a fully developed personal daily notes section** — Not all will be this complete, but this gives a good example of how data should be organized. 
            - **[Example](<Example.md>):** ((last update: Jan 28, 2021 — see recent DNPs for up-to-date examples))
                - #[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) {{word-count}}

                            1. **Established Graph!** 
                            2. Processes added
                                - [Feedback](<Feedback.md>)
                            3. Added directory

                            9. Added #[Q](<Q.md>)
                                - Questions that come up while answering a prompt. They don't stand alone so don't work well as open questions — but they are helpful to tag so that you can review the references on those tags. These are great opportunities for collaborative commentary. ((This feels kinda confusing — happy to elaborate on it if unclear.))
                            10. Added [Frequently Asked Questions](<Frequently Asked Questions.md>)
                            11. Added #[Everyone](<Everyone.md>) tag
                                - Similar to the @Channel feature in [Slack](<Slack.md>)...
                                    - Can use `@[Everyone](<Everyone.md>)` to elevate something to everyone's attention. 
                                        - [Q](<Q.md>) How could [notifications](<notifications.md>) be managed with this? @/~ wouldn't work bc when would you switch it?
                            12. Added [Welcome](<Welcome.md>) and the Getting Started sections 
                            13. Added [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>)
                        - #[GTD Zone](<GTD Zone.md>)

                            7. [x] Add Roam42 and Smartblocks
                                - Stability ok for multiplayer

                                - Background colour consistency... Dark grey vs light grey — what's the distinction?
                            12. [x] Clarify the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) conventions for [Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>)
                            13. [ ] Create some structure around the first [Roam Games](<Roam Games.md>) challenge [February 1st, 2021](<February 1st, 2021.md>) 
                            14. [x] Establish a "[Daily Activities](<Daily Activities.md>)" workflow. [Processes](<Processes.md>)
                                - Each day, one is added to the top of the page. Selected by anyone if it's not already there.

                                - Members of the space adhere to shared conventions that facilitate clear and orderly communication. 
                                - It is easy to tell what is going on. 
                                - It is easy to contribute.
                                - It is accessible to "intermediate users"

                                    - How can we effectively "seed" graphs with baseline information?
                                        - Depending on features used, JSON or markdown exports should work relatively well for this.
                                            - When cross-graph linking comes, it could be as simple has hosting a source graph.

                            - Originally, I liked this syntax: `[@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]` (from [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) II]]), but I kinda like this one `[@](<@.md>)`... 
                                - The latter gives you the ability to view ALL UNREADS across the graph. Plus, you can still filter `[@](<@.md>)` by your name to find YOUR unreads.

                        2. #[N](<N.md>) Strong conventions within a [collaborative graph]([collaborative graphs](<collaborative graphs.md>)) help to maintain [order](<order.md>) and mitigate [chaos](<chaos.md>).
                        3. #[N](<N.md>) The biggest hurdle is in ESTABLISHING shared conventions. Once they are set and understood, the system fades, and emphasis directs towards the content.
                        4. #[Questions](<Questions.md>) How can we prevent a collaborative graph from feeling overwhelming?
                            - Maybe through strong onboarding? Clubhouse calls to address questions? Encouraging the use of the `[Questions](<Questions.md>)` to create dialogue about conventions.
                        5. #[N](<N.md>) The Zettelkasten might be the best place for open questions... as they can be blended with assertions and other ideas. Less filing burden ("where does this go?").
                        6. [I](<I.md>) — Might change `[Comments](<Comments.md>)` to `[Commentary](<Commentary.md>)`... feels more clear that it's commentary on stuff within the graph. [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)

                            - For book club:

                                    - Thinking of something like what [Sam Marfleet](<Sam Marfleet.md>) made for [Books/Hero of a Thousand Faces](<Books/Hero of a Thousand Faces.md>)...

                        1. What goals or objectives would you like to work towards with [Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>)? [*](((ODwYwd-L7)))
                            - To create a [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>) that can be used to support multiplayer Roam communities.
                        3. From the references on `[Open Questions](<Open Questions.md>)`: What is the best method of notifications?
                            - The `@` and `~` convention from [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) II]] seemed to work well.
                            - #[Q](<Q.md>) Is this only possible if "only edit your blocks" is disabled?
                        4. How to tag ideas related to graph conventions and processes?
                            - Under `[[[Feedback](<[[Feedback.md>): [Suggestions](<Suggestions.md>)]]`?
                        5. How important is it to stick to vanilla Roam?
                    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>)
                        1. [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) any blocks you create we can't edit/delete — just something to keep in mind (see the duplicate comments and feedback sections below) — fixed
                        1. [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) how do you feel about using templates? I like these daily note headings — I think using either templates or smartblocks could be great to standardize structure... Love templates, they help to facilitate structure — started some [here]([Graph/Templates](<Graph/Templates.md>))
                            - Feel free to add some! You could make a `[Templates](<Templates.md>)` section in your DNP section, and create some [SmartBlocks](<SmartBlocks.md>) there [Processes](<Processes.md>) [templates](<templates.md>)
                        1. Added [roam/css](<roam/css.md>)
                            - I copy/pasted from another shared graph so I'm not sure what's there yet haha. Will sift through later.
                        2. **Creating new pages.** All new pages should be ^^LOWERCASE^^, except:
                            - I know this sounds restrictive, but it is really important to compile ideas optimally. 
                            - Nothing will "break" if you don't follow this, but it will lead to a bunch of sorta-related page names and some missed connections.
                        3. [Woah](<Woah.md>) the new "unread block references" feature is AWESOME!! 
                        6. [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) Also, think that it could be valuable to build out a tag for relevant references or resources. Ideally these would be ones related to the goals of the graph...
                            - Yup this is a great idea. 
                            - Maybe `[Resources](<Resources.md>)`? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)
                                - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] This would work. In my personal graph is use block level tags to identify resources and then aggregate them in a central location...
                                    - Yup, this is exactly the workflow I have in mind! 
Community suggests via block-level tagging, then graph editors compile them centrally. 
                        7. Just created my bio page at this point. Still reading through the extensive documentation 🤣
                            - I just thinned it out a bunch haha
                    - [Chat](<Chat.md>)
                        - Thoughts on this? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>), [Everyone](<Everyone.md>): Block ref the sections to add your ideas around mission, vision, purpose, goals, etc.
                            - Feels like a good way to converge ideas on something. 
                            - Note the use of the (()) symbol on [About Roam Collective](<About Roam Collective.md>)
                        - [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>) — Added [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>) as a target artifact for this group. My thoughts is that if we can work to collaborate towards a finished product here, we can port the processes into [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>) and other communities. 
                            - My thoughts on process: [Processes](<Processes.md>)
                                - Use block references to the table of contents to gather ideas on the content of each section
                                - Editors help to compile the content within the references into the contents of each section
                                - Synchronous conversation (Clubhouse) and Slack can be used to iron out any points of contention.
                - 
    - Engaging in conversation & commenting on parts of the graph.
    - Using the [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>).
    - Contributing to the [collaborative zettelkasten](<collaborative zettelkasten.md>).
