        - Within a knowledge graph, there are a lot of paths that could be taken to populate content and "fill out" the graph. To keep it fun and engaging, and to optimize [productivity](<productivity.md>), populate the graph [opportunistically](<opportunistically.md>). Take the path you are most [inspired](<inspired.md>) to take.
        - The exception to this is the population of essential structure and time-sensitive projects. Prioritize what needs to be done first, and apply this principle within those constraints. 
        - Clear targets, [objectives](<objectives.md>), direction, and [goals](<goals.md>) help to keep the direction of graph development in alignment with the community [purpose](<purpose.md>).
