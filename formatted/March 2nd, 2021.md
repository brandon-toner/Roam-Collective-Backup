            - **Suggestions for "Next":**
                1. Mature the backlog conventions. 
                    - This should be easy -- we're 90% there.
                2. Prepare a JSON file as a **"collective graph starter pack"** 
                    - We have most of the components now -- we likely just need to tidy up some CSS, add some instructions, and form the JSON. 
                        - Will also need to think of how we keep it current.
        - [I](<I.md>) I'm thinking [sprints](<sprints.md>) show NOT be named. Just date ranges... with the content of the sprint on the page?
            - "projects" should be listed on the sprint pages as places to focus efforts.
            - [FN](<FN.md>) There should only be **one** active [sprint]([sprints](<sprints.md>)) at a time. 
            - [FN](<FN.md>) [sprints](<sprints.md>) should have a defined time window that is firm / non-negotiable.
                - If project work assigned to a sprint is not completed, it can be included in the next sprint.
            - [FN](<FN.md>) [sprints](<sprints.md>) should be defined by time rather than project content.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**
                    - **[Not this: "[Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)](<Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies).md>) "Status](<Not this: "[Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)](<Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies).md>) "Status.md>):** [Status/Active](<Status/Active.md>)""
                        - This sprint should have been resolved after 1-2 weeks, and a component of managing dependencies be built using a project.

                - Excellent. As conversation evolves, I'll offer our support for setting up RC conventions to ensure a smooth implementation.
                - I think the "Think Tank" experiment will operate much better within a shared graph. Imagine ~10 daily active writers collaborating in this fashion.
                - Lots of potential here! 
                - Slack is too lossy and too linear for the wide array of topics that will be on the table. 
            - "Ugh...Communities. Vote for tech stack preference on slack! "
