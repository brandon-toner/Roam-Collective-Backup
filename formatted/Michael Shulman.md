    - I'm a 5th year PhD student at [George Mason University](<George Mason University.md>), in [Fairfax](<Fairfax.md>) [Virginia](<Virginia.md>). I've been studying [teams](<teams.md>) and [multiteam systems](<multiteam systems.md>), and have grown fascinated by the synergy between tech and us. 
        - This is why I'm fascinated by what's being done in collaborative Roam. I'm coming from the [psychology](<psychology.md>) side, and currently working to present the psych field with a good overview of how to think about tech, and to include how the tech world might think about the [teamwork processes](<teamwork processes.md>) studied in psych - how they are helped and challenged by various aspects of tech. 
    - I started using [Roam](<Roam.md>) in [February 2020](<February 2020.md>)
        - Other tools I'd have a hard time living without, or that there aren't good substitutes for: [DEVONthink](<DEVONthink.md>) [Amazing Marvin](<Amazing Marvin.md>) [Liquid Text](<Liquid Text.md>)
