        - [[[Q:](<[[Q:.md>) How could an "[agile](<agile.md>)" approach to collaboration be implemented in Roam Collective?]]
        - **[Thoughts](<Thoughts.md>):** `Work Summary` attribute
            - Purpose: to orient team members working on the question/sprint/epic
            - A place to log/link to related work elsewhere in the database.
            - [Q](<Q.md>) How do you prevent the need to duplicate the log in several places in the graph?
                - **[Solution](<Solution.md>):** Block embeds.
                    - Work done on questions and sprints are embedded on their relevant epics. 
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):** [here](((fPjw916JP)))
                    - Work on pages related to a sprint are embedded on the sprint.
        - Feeling the need for some other block-level tag like "observation" maybe...
            - Right now, I use Q and I â€” but I'd like to be able to log simple observations
                - These could be statements/problems about the way things are. 
                - This would serve as an important anchor for driving the dialogue between A and A.
            - Proposed workflow:
                - Make **observation**
                - Phrase as **question**
                    - Document Q-pages as they arise.
                - Come up with some related **ideas**
                    - Document FN, SDL, etc as they arise. 
                - Cycles naturally through these, inviting collaboration as necessary.
            - Testing it out: [Obs](<Obs.md>)

        1. Upgraded [Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]])' block-level question on agile to page-level. Lots of ideas around that lately.
