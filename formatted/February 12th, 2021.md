                    - Work on pages related to a sprint are embedded on the sprint.
        - Feeling the need for some other block-level tag like "observation" maybe...
            - Right now, I use Q and I ‚Äî but I'd like to be able to log simple observations
                - These could be statements/problems about the way things are. 
                - This would serve as an important anchor for driving the dialogue between A and A.
            - Proposed workflow:
                - Make **observation**
                - Phrase as **question**
                    - Document Q-pages as they arise.
                - Come up with some related **ideas**
                    - Document FN, SDL, etc as they arise. 
                - Cycles naturally through these, inviting collaboration as necessary.

            1. Dedicate a Roam graph to team work.
            2. Add content directly in the right context.
            3. Use Daily Notes as output.
            4. Write down everything.
            5. Write down only once.
            6. Use tags and notifications sparingly.
            7. Spend time tweaking custom CSS.
            8. Embrace the messiness of a graph.
            9. Roam's upsides make up for its downsides.
        - **[Thoughts](<Thoughts.md>):** [namespaces](<namespaces.md>)
            - Two types:

                - Native slash-style
            - **[Comments](<Comments.md>):**
                - A page can only have ONE namespace. 
                    - These can be nested hierarchically, but it's very [file-folder](<file-folder.md>)-y
                - #[N](<N.md>) [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) should be reserved for pages with a clear categorization.
                - **[#[N](<N.md>) A `Tags](<#[N](<N.md>) A `Tags.md>):**` attribute can be used to designate [collections](<collections.md>) and sub-collections, using a combination of tags.
                - Why I'm thinking about this:
                    - Is something a resource or a roam game submission? Can it be both?

            - **Building on:** [Charles' work on agile in Roam](((74aPTS1FT)))
            - Epics = big picture surrounding a meaningful question.
            - Really, a Roam Games question feels big enough in scope for an Epic, but the time-frame pushes it to feel more at-home as a sprint.
                - Maybe this addresses [this](((RJj8IZlGp)))[*]([~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]])
            - [Epics]([epics](<epics.md>)) = the thing to be developed/answered/accomplished
            - [Sprints]([sprints](<sprints.md>)) = the unit of work
            - Here's the workflow I imagine: ((okkkk this might be a marathon haha))
                1. Explore ideas loosely in the form of the various options for tags (Q, I, Obs, FN, EN)
                    - #[N](<N.md>) [These tags](((foYwq0l3e))) (in combination with page links for keywords) provide a framework to labelling the meandering thoughts ‚Äî¬†allowing ideas to persist across time and related ideas to accumulate.
                2. Once work starts to center around some common [themes](<themes.md>), [questions](<questions.md>) and [ideas](<ideas.md>), they could start to take the form of a defined "[epic]([epics](<epics.md>))".
                    - An [epic]([epics](<epics.md>)) is an objective centered around an open question or development milestone. [*]([Definitions](<Definitions.md>))
                3. The epic should be formed using the [epic template](((Gx7UUAS7L))), and information on the template should be populated to gather all relevant information in one place.
                    - This becomes the hub of the mission.
                4. Epics are big though... sometimes they can feel too big or overwhelming to tackle. This is where [sprints](<sprints.md>) come in.
                    - Sprints are the manageable units of work associated with an epic.[*]([Definitions](<Definitions.md>))
                    - **[Related](<Related.md>):** [Evergreens/How do you eat an elephant?](<Evergreens/How do you eat an elephant?.md>)
                5. Sprints are formed to break epics into manageable pieces. These should be populated using the [sprints template](((tG1HJs2dK)))
                6. Sprints and epics should be easily visible on the daily notes page each day ‚Äî giving users the ability to see at-a-glance what the group is converging around. 
                7. Work related to sprints should be conducted within each user's DNP Section & referenced into the [Work Summary section](((JZ6S734y4))), as a rolling log of work completed by all team members.
                8. As work accumulates, members (or a sprint leader) should then review the bits of work, **assembling the pieces into a summary document**. This is the [deliverable]([deliverables](<deliverables.md>)) of the sprint.  
                    - #[N](<N.md>) By breaking down epics into [intermediate packets](<intermediate packets.md>) or [intermediate deliverables](<intermediate deliverables.md>) (as phrased by [Conor]([Conor White-Sullivan](<Conor White-Sullivan.md>))), collaboration, the remixing of work, and the management of [dependencies](<dependencies.md>) becomes easier.[*](((RyuMSELI3)))
                        - [Seedlings](<Seedlings.md>) Breaking down work into intermediate packets improves collaboration, agility, and dependency management. 
                9. Once a sprint is adequately completed, the team can then move to the next priority component of the epic. 
                10. Repeat.
        - Conversation with Charles:
            - Epic = question
            - Sprint = group of tasks, the work
            - Story points = outline of components of the epic
            - Idea of [prepositional linkages](<prepositional linkages.md>)

            - [Evergreens/Claim 2](<Evergreens/Claim 2.md>)
            - #[N](<N.md>) the [relevant notes](<relevant notes.md>) attribute can be used to house the relationships between [claims](<claims.md>) using [prepositional linkages](<prepositional linkages.md>).
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** supported by:: [Evergreens/Claim 2](<Evergreens/Claim 2.md>)
            - #[N](<N.md>) [prepositional linkages](<prepositional linkages.md>) should be past-tense in tone. 
                - It is easier (possible) to build off of existing claims than it is to connect to future claims. 
                - This process allows a continuous documentation of [dependencies](<dependencies.md>) as [development](<development.md>) progresses.
                - Not certain about this. There may be contexts where future-tense will be necessary ‚Äî I'm curious to evaluate those circumstances.
            - #[N](<N.md>) [prepositional linkages]([prepositional linkages](<prepositional linkages.md>)) can be used within a graph database to track [dependencies](<dependencies.md>).[*]([Epics/Managing knowledge dependencies in multiplayer](<Epics/Managing knowledge dependencies in multiplayer.md>))
                - #[N](<N.md>) Making the prepositional links between ideas explicit empowers the mapping of a complex matrix of relationships and dependencies.
                    - [Seedlings/The use of prepositional linkages empowers the mapping of dependencies and relationships in a graph database.](<Seedlings/The use of prepositional linkages empowers the mapping of dependencies and relationships in a graph database..md>) 
            - [Obs](<Obs.md>) I'm often looking for a `response tag` to a `[Q](<Q.md>)`...
                - Sometimes this is an `[I](<I.md>)` for ideas, but sometimes it feels like I need an `[A](<A.md>)` for Answer.
                - So, I'm adding an `[A](<A.md>)` block-level tag for use in response to a `[Q](<Q.md>)` tag, when an answer feels appropriate.
                    - [Obs](<Obs.md>) A feels a bit definitive sometimes... but I'm reframing this mentally as the `A` designates **AN** answer, not **THE** answer.

        - [@Peter]([~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]) on `Obs` vs `Ob`
            - [@Peter]([@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]) [on "Ob" vs "Obs"](((7TT80uRn7))): I think "Obs" is the standard abbreviation for "Observation" or "Observed"
            - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) [on "Ob" vs "Obs"](((iEONmm8aD))) If it's a standard then I think it's perfect. It's good to have an "element" for each collection, but does this increase the chance of having too many collection tags? I like the idea, I am just worried about the structure becoming too complex for no reason.
                - It's not a required tag by any means, and not an essential part of any collaborative structure. "[Beneficial, but optional]([Evergreens/beneficial, but optional](<Evergreens/beneficial, but optional.md>))"... so it's more a take-it-or-leave it kinda convention. (Not worried about over-complexity here)
        - [@Peter]([@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]) On messaging conventions [*](((HeW5OoT_5)))
            -  Yea, I like it. Particularly the @[name]. I find it a bit more natural to toss the ref in an alias or in context some times ‚Äî but that's nothing that needs to be universal in style. As long as its there is the main thing to converge on as a group.
            - It also brings up the idea of using [@Everyone]([@[[Everyone](<@[[Everyone.md>)]]) as a universal notification place... [*]([~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]), [*]([@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]])
                - Of course, this inbox couldn't be cleared, but it could serve as a rolling inbox for people to check in on periodically. 
                - Not sure if @ or cc would be best... probably @ for higher priority/request for input, cc for lower as usual. 
                    - You'll be less likely to *get* input unless people have the habit of checking that inbox... which is a bit labour intensive, but I donno.
                    - I still prefer the top-section "Chat" for elevation. This could be used in combo no problem, though. It's non-destructive.
        - On [Charles' personal system](((vxaP_RzP-))):[*]([^[[Charles Farr](<^[[Charles Farr.md>)]])
            - `[Obs](<Obs.md>)` / `[Observations](<Observations.md>)` ‚Äî summarizing literature or resources in one or multiple concise statements
                - Ha! [Same tag](((cxK_gynrp))) ‚Äî different use context... 
                    - I'm conceptualizing Obs/Observations as being much more broad than __observations on specific literature__.
            - `[Syn](<Syn.md>)` / `[S:](<S:.md>)` pages ‚Äî new synthesized "evergreen" thoughts
                - I like this in a personal system, or one focused on the synthesis of knowledge in a research-like approach ‚Äî but I think Evergreen is appropriate in RC as it is more broad in definition. (concepts and claims, rather than just claims)
                    - I do think that claims could be further sub-tagged in the EN structure though. Addition of a `[Claims](<Claims.md>)` tag would suit here for more "synthesis notes"
            - `[Q](<Q.md>)` / `[Questions](<Questions.md>)` / `[Q:](<Q:.md>)` ‚Äî my knowledge graph is organized around answering one or multiple questions; essentially, questions are output oriented...
                - Similar to existing RC conventions.
            - `[Collection](<Collection.md>)` ‚Äî general purpose speculative outlines that organize around a topic or concept, not a central question
                - Feels too close in name to "Collections" as a type of tag in general. But would work well in a personal graph.
            - `[Notion](<Notion.md>)` ‚Äî "a general understanding;" "vague or imperfect conception or idea of something;" "an opinion, view, or belief;" a general "conception or idea" ‚Äî [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/notion)
                - This is intriguing ‚Äî I'm thinking the role of a Notion note would be satisfied by the space around FN and SDL
                    - Level of [uncertainty](<uncertainty.md>) could be eventually captured with a **confidence level** attribute.

            - Stories is the part that I haven't been able to work in yet ‚Äî feels too zoomed in maybe? Sprints are already pretty high-res. I think I conceptualize stories as  being outlines on an epic that are worked upon during a sprint. I don't find the "user stories" metaphor clicks with me at all haha

            - I would argue that the uses aren't that dissimilar at all! The idea of an observation is just to summarize something tangible ‚Äî something that happened or is concrete, which could be an insight from a book/research or an example within this graph.
                - It is distinct from a Fleeting Note or an Evergreen Note in that it contains some objective truth, evidenced by an actual fact in the world. Evergreen notes build on ideas (notions, Fleeting Notes, whatever)
        - On the holy concept of MECE ([Seedlings/mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE)](<Seedlings/mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE).md>))
            - In [consulting]([cc:[[Larissa de Lima](<cc:[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]]), when assessing a system, solution, or just a set of options, we would use MECE to test it's strength.

            - The overall goal was to ensure that..

                    - This ensures there is a clear definition of said __thing__, ultimately eliminating risk of confusion
                - All of the __things__ added up to constitute the whole of the category of interest ‚Äî in doing you, you've mapped the entire problem-/solution-space. The options are collectively exhaustive.
