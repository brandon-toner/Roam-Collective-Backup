    - [Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>) 
        - Added page: [[[Q:](<[[Q:.md>) How could an "[agile](<agile.md>)" approach to collaboration be implemented in Roam Collective?]]
        - **[Thoughts](<Thoughts.md>):** `Work Summary` attribute[*]([[[Q:](<[[Q:.md>) How could an "[agile](<agile.md>)" approach to collaboration be implemented in Roam Collective?]])
            - Purpose: to orient team members working on the question/sprint/epic
            - A place to log/link to related work elsewhere in the database.
            - [Q](<Q.md>) How do you prevent the need to duplicate the log in several places in the graph?
                - **[Solution](<Solution.md>):** Block embeds.
                    - Work done on questions and sprints are embedded on their relevant epics. 
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):** [here](((fPjw916JP)))
                    - Work on pages related to a sprint are embedded on the sprint.
        - Feeling the need for some other block-level tag like "observation" maybe...
            - Right now, I use Q and I â€” but I'd like to be able to log simple observations
                - These could be statements/problems about the way things are. 
                - This would serve as an important anchor for driving the dialogue between A and A.
            - Proposed workflow:
                - Make **observation**
                - Phrase as **question**
                    - Document Q-pages as they arise.
                - Come up with some related **ideas**
                    - Document FN, SDL, etc as they arise. 
                - Cycles naturally through these, inviting collaboration as necessary.
            - Testing it out: [Obs](<Obs.md>)
        - [Mat McGann](<Mat McGann.md>)'s "9 Things I Learned" while running his startup in a multiplayer graph.
            1. Dedicate a Roam graph to team work.
            2. Add content directly in the right context.
            3. Use Daily Notes as output.
            4. Write down everything.
            5. Write down only once.
            6. Use tags and notifications sparingly.
            7. Spend time tweaking custom CSS.
            8. Embrace the messiness of a graph.
            9. Roam's upsides make up for its downsides.
        - **[Thoughts](<Thoughts.md>):** [namespaces](<namespaces.md>)
            - Two types:
                - Nested Links
                - Native slash-style
            - **[Comments](<Comments.md>):**
                - A page can only have ONE namespace. 
                    - These can be nested hierarchically, but it's very [file-folder](<file-folder.md>)-y
                - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) should be reserved for pages with a clear categorization.
                - **[#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) A `Tags](<#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) A `Tags.md>):**` attribute can be used to designate [collections](<collections.md>) and sub-collections, using a combination of tags.
                - Why I'm thinking about this:
                    - Is something a resource or a roam game submission? Can it be both?
        - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) A test for strength of [conventions](<conventions.md>): Are categories [mutually-exclusive](<mutually-exclusive.md>) when a categorization decision is necessary?
            - [Q](<Q.md>) What conventions should be [mutually-exclusive](<mutually-exclusive.md>)? 
                - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) conventions with overlap in utility or lack-of-clarity of use should be flagged as `[Tensions](<Tensions.md>)` to allow for re-evaluation and resolution.

    - #[Change Log](<Change Log.md>) 
        1. Upgraded [Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]])' block-level question on agile to page-level. Lots of ideas around that lately.

                - This thread of messages could be observed from evolution of language. Brandon and I developed a way to message which might either stabilize for some time, or evolve over time. The graph show evidence of linguistic evolution.
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) Could we do a social study of the graph? Interactions, language  and structures are continuously changing.

            - also, trying a new tag to indicate `@` who I am speaking to, `""` What I am referring to (if I am not kinking to a word or a sentence), thoughts?
        - [@Brandon]([@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) [on "Ob" vs "Obs"](((iEONmm8aD))) If it's a standard then I think it's perfect. It's good to have an "element" for each collection, but does this increase the chance of having too many collection tags? I like the idea, I am just worried about the structure becoming too complex for no reason.
        - [@Brandon]([@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) [on "This new messaging structure"](((iEONmm8aD))) I think we reinvented emails. We now are using objects! For Other people reading messages, I think it makes it very easy to parse.
