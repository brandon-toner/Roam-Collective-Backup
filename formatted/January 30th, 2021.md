                - **[URL](<URL.md>):**¬†https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/
                - As a child, I had a goofy recurring daydream: maybe if I type just the right sequence of keys, the computer would beep a few times in sly recognition, then a hidden world would suddenly unlock before my eyes. I‚Äôd find myself with new powers which I could use to transcend my humdrum life. 
                - This guide assumes basic familiarity with spaced repetition systems. For an introduction, see Michael Nielsen, Augmenting Long-term Memory (2018), which is also the source of the phrase ‚Äúmakes memory a choice.‚Äù 
                - At their best, these systems feel like magic.This guide assumes basic familiarity with spaced repetition systems. For an introduction, see Michael Nielsen, Augmenting Long-term Memory (2018), which is also the source of the phrase ‚Äúmakes memory a choice.‚Äù Memory ceases to be a haphazard phenomenon, something you hope happens: spaced repetition systems make memory a choice. Used well, they can accelerate learning, facilitate creative work, and more. 
                - Spaced repetition systems work only as well as the prompts you give them. 
                    - #[Literature Notes](<Literature Notes.md>)
                - This guide aims to help you create understanding in the context of an informational resource like an article or talk. By that I mean writing prompts not only to durably internalize the overt knowledge presented by the author, but also to produce and reinforce understandings of your own, understandings which you can carry into your life and creative work. 
                - The central role of retrieval practice 
                    - [h2](<h2.md>)
                - The most common mechanism of change for spaced repetition learning tasks is called retrieval practice. 
                    - [retrieval practice](<retrieval practice.md>)
                - See e.g. Karpicke and Blunt, Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping (2011); and Blunt and Karpicke, Learning With Retrieval-Based Concept Mapping (2014). 
                    - [Resources](<Resources.md>) [Studies](<Studies.md>)
                - The learning produced by retrieval is called the ‚Äútesting effect‚Äù because it occurs when you explicitly test yourself, reaching within to recall some knowledge from the tangle of your mind. Such tests look like typical school exams, but in some sense they‚Äôre the opposite: retrieval practice is about testing your knowledge to produce learning, rather than to assess learning. 
                    - [retrieval practice](<retrieval practice.md>)
                - For more background on the mnemonic medium, see Matuschak and Nielsen, How can we develop transformative tools for thought? (2019). 
                    - [Resources](<Resources.md>) [mnemonic medium](<mnemonic medium.md>)
                - These embedded prompts are part of an ongoing research project. The first experiment in the mnemonic medium was Quantum Country, a primer on quantum computation. Quantum Country is concrete and technical: definitions, notation, laws. By contrast, this guide mostly presents heuristics, mental models, and advice.

                - Properties of effective retrieval practice prompts 
                    - [h3](<h3.md>)
                - Writing good prompts feels surprisingly similar to translating written text. When translating prose into another language, you‚Äôre asking: which words, when read, would light a similar set of bulbs in readers‚Äô minds? 
                    - #[Literature Notes](<Literature Notes.md>) Writing prompts is similar to writing [literature notes](<literature notes.md>), which is similar to translating text between languages
                - Retrieval practice prompts should be focused. A question or answer involving too much detail will dull your concentration and stimulate incomplete retrievals, leaving some bulbs unlit. Unfocused questions also make it harder to check whether you remembered all parts of the answer and to note places where you differed. It‚Äôs usually best to focus on one detail at a time. 
                - Retrieval practice prompts should be precise about what they‚Äôre asking for. Vague questions will elicit vague answers, which won‚Äôt reliably light the bulbs you‚Äôre targeting. 
                - Retrieval practice prompts should produce consistent answers 
                - Retrieval practice prompts should be tractable. 
                - Retrieval practice prompts should be effortful 
                - So we must learn two skills to write effective retrieval practice prompts: how to characterize exactly what knowledge we‚Äôll reinforce, and how to ask questions which reinforce that knowledge. 
                - How to make and store chicken stock: factual and procedural knowledge 
                    - [h2](<h2.md>)
                - Simple facts
                    - We could write a prompt which simply asks: ‚ÄúWhat do you need to make chicken stock?‚Äù But this isn‚Äôt precise enough: should we recall the quantities or just the names of the ingredients? How much chicken stock are we making? This isn‚Äôt focused enough: because it‚Äôs asking for so many details simultaneously, it‚Äôs unlikely to sharply activate all the memories you want to reinforce. And because it‚Äôs asking for so much, it‚Äôs liable to lead to inconsistency and intractability: each time you answer, you‚Äôll remember some details and forget others. The inconsistent activations will tend to erode your memory. 
                - Writing a simple factual prompt like that naturally tickles a neighbor you might consider adding: the explanation prompt. I write prompts like this when a detail seems likely to be challenging or when the explanation itself is interesting. 
                    - [Example](<Example.md>)
                - Q. Why do we use bones to make chicken stock?
                    - A. They‚Äôre full of gelatin, which produces a rich texture. 
                - Q. What type of chicken parts are used in stock?
                    - A. Bones. 
                - Q. How do bones produce a chicken stock‚Äôs rich texture?
                    - A. They‚Äôre full of gelatin. 
                - Lists
                - Back to the ingredients list. Chicken stock obviously involves chicken and water: that follows from the definition of stock (which we‚Äôll handle later). But then there are all the aromatic flavorings, which are more variable and depend somewhat on application. Understanding the ingredients in terms of functional grouping will help us internalize the structure of the recipe: 
                - Most spaced repetition software a has special function which can rapidly generate sets of fill-in-the-blank prompts like this. In the software interfaces, these prompts are often called ‚Äúcloze deletions.‚Äù In each review session, the software will only ask you to fill in one blank. This behavior is important because without it, one variant would ‚Äúgive away‚Äù the answer to another. 
                    - [cloze deletions](<cloze deletions.md>)
                - Cues and elaborative encoding
                - If you find yourself struggling with these prompts, it can be helpful to add a cue, 
                - But make sure the cue doesn‚Äôt render the prompt trivial: it‚Äôs important that that you exert some effort to retrieve the answer from memory. 
                - This prompt doesn‚Äôt require you to retrieve any knowledge about chicken stock: there‚Äôs only one vegetable which rhymes with ‚Äúparrots.‚Äù You could answer this without having ever read the recipe. By contrast, the previous prompt‚Äôs cue‚Äî‚Äúherb‚Äù‚Äîleaves your memory with work to do. There are many herbs, and you‚Äôll still need to remember which one the recipe specified.
                - That said, ‚Äúrhymes with parrots‚Äù may be a useful mnemonic device to add to the answer, offering an association to help you in the future 
                - Prompts are cheaper than you probably imagine. An easy prompt will consume 10‚Äì30 seconds across the entire first year of practice, and much less in each subsequent year. Until you‚Äôve internalized that observation, try to adopt this rule of thumb: write more prompts than feels natural. 
                    - #[Annotations](<Annotations.md>) Write more [prompts](<prompts.md>) than feels natural.
                - Now, prompts are cheap, but they‚Äôre not free. Besides their time cost, they have an emotional cost: no one wants to spend time reviewing a bunch of boring material they already know. 
                - Procedural knowledge
                - Now that we‚Äôve got prompts for the ingredients, let‚Äôs look at the steps of the recipe. This is procedural knowledge‚Äîknowledge needed to perform specific tasks, more knowing how than knowing what.

                - Toulmin Argument 
                - What is the Toulmin Method? 
                - Developed by philosopher Stephen E. Toulmin, the Toulmin method is a style of argumentation that breaks arguments down into six component parts: claim, grounds, warrant, qualifier, rebuttal, and backing. In Toulmin‚Äôs method, every argument begins with three fundamental parts: the claim, the grounds, and the warrant. 
                - A¬†claim¬†is the assertion that authors would like to prove to their audience. It is, in other words, the main argument. 
                - The¬†grounds¬†of an argument are the evidence and facts that help support the claim. 
                - Finally, the¬†warrant, which is either implied or stated explicitly, is the assumption that links the grounds to the claim. 
                - The other three elements‚Äîbacking, qualifier, and rebuttal‚Äîare not fundamental to a Toulmin argument, but may be added as necessary. Using these elements wisely can help writers construct full, nuanced arguments. 
                - Backing¬†refers to any additional support of the warrant. In many cases, the warrant is implied, and therefore the backing provides support for the warrant by giving a specific example that justifies the warrant. 
                - The¬†qualifier¬†shows that a claim may not be true in all circumstances. Words like ‚Äúpresumably,‚Äù ‚Äúsome,‚Äù and ‚Äúmany‚Äù help your audience understand that you know there are instances where your claim may not be correct. 
                - The¬†rebuttal¬†is an acknowledgement of another valid view of the situation. 
                - Including a qualifier or a rebuttal in an argument helps build your ethos, or credibility. When you acknowledge that your view isn‚Äôt always true or when you provide multiple views of a situation, you build an image of a careful, unbiased thinker, rather than of someone blindly pushing for a single interpretation of the situation. 
                - Note that, in addition to Stephen Toulmin‚Äôs¬†Uses of Argument, students and instructors may find it useful to consult the article ‚ÄúUsing Toulmin‚Äôs Model of Argumentation‚Äù by Joan Karbach for more information.

                - In ancient Greece and Rome, rhetoric was most often considered to be the art of persuasion and was primarily described as a spoken skill. 
                - Aristotle provides a crucial point of reference for ancient and modern scholars alike. Over 2000 years ago, Aristotle literally wrote the book on rhetoric. His text¬†Rhƒìtorik·∏ó(On Rhetoric) explores the techniques and purposes of persuasion in ancient Greece, laying the foundation for the study and implementation of rhetoric in future generations. 
                - Below, you will find a brief guide to some of the most fundamental concepts in classical rhetoric, most of which originate in¬†On Rhetoric. 
                - The Rhetorical Appeals 
                - To understand how argument works in¬†On Rhetoric, you must first understand the major appeals associated with rhetoric. Aristotle identifies four major rhetorical appeals: ethos (credibility), logos (logic), pathos (emotion), and Kairos(time). 
                    - [Aristotle](<Aristotle.md>) [rhetoric](<rhetoric.md>)
                - Ethos ‚Äì an appeal to credibility. This is the way a speaker (or writer) presents herself to the audience. You can build credibility by citing professional sources, using content-specific language, and by showing evidence of your ethical, knowledgeable background. 
                    - [ethos](<ethos.md>) = appeal to [credibility](<credibility.md>).
                - Logos ‚Äì an appeal to logic. This is the way a speaker appeals to the audience through practicality and hard evidence. You can develop logos by presenting data and statistics, and by crafting a clear claim with a logically-sequenced argument. 
                    - [logos](<logos.md>) = appeal to [logic](<logic.md>).
                - Pathos ‚Äì an appeal to emotion. This is the way a speaker appeals to the audience through emotion, pity, or passions. The idea is usually to evoke and strengthen feelings already present within the audience. This can be achieved through story-telling, vivid imagery, and an impassioned voice. 
                    - [pathos](<pathos.md>) = appeal to [emotion](<emotion.md>).
                - Kairos ‚Äì an appeal made through the adept use of time. This is the way a speaker appeals to the audience through notions of time. It is also considered to be the appropriate or opportune time for a speaker to insert herself into a conversation or discourse, using the three appeals listed above. A Kairotic appeal can be made through calls to immediate action, presenting an opportunity as temporary, and by describing a specific moment as propitious¬†or ideal. 
                    - [kairos](<kairos.md>) = appeal to adept use of [time](<time.md>).
                - An easy way to conceptualize the rhetorical appeals is through advertisements, particularly infomercials or commercials. We are constantly being exposed to the types of rhetoric above, whether it be while watching television or movies, browsing the internet, or watching videos on YouTube. 
                - Imagine a commercial for a new car. The commercial opens with images of a family driving a brand-new car through rugged, forested terrain, over large rocks, past waterfalls, and finally to a serene camping spot near a tranquil lake surrounded by giant redwood trees. The scene cuts to shots of the interior of the car, showing off its technological capacities and its impressive spaciousness. A voiceover announces that not only has this car won numerous awards over its competitors but that it is also priced considerably lower than comparable models, while getting better gas mileage. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt wait,‚Äù the voiceover says excitedly, ‚Äúcurrent lessees pay 0% APR financing for 12 months.‚Äù 
                - Imagine a commercial for a new car.

                - In just a few moments, this commercial has shown masterful use of all four appeals. The commercial utilizes pathos by appealing to our romantic notions of family, escape, and the great outdoors. The commercial develops ethos by listing its awards, and it appeals to our logical tendencies by pointing out we will save money immediately because the car is priced lower than its competitors, as well as in the long run because of its higher MPG rate. Finally, the commercial provides an opportune and propitious moment for its targeted audience to purchase a car immediately.

                - Components and Structure 
                - The classical argument is made up of five components, which are most commonly composed in the following order: 
                - Exordium ‚Äì¬†The introduction, opening, or hook. 
                - Narratio ‚Äì¬†The context or background of the topic. 
                - Proposito and Partitio ‚Äì¬†The claim/stance and the argument. 
                - Confirmatio and/or Refutatio ‚Äì¬†positive proofs and negative proofs of support. 
                - Peroratio ‚Äì¬†The conclusion and call to action. 
                - In your exordium, you have an opportunity to gain the interest of your reader, but you also have the responsibility of situating the argument and setting the tone of your writing. 
                - This is also a good opportunity to consider who your intended audience is and to address their concerns within the context of the argument. 
                - For example, if you were¬†writing an argument on the importance of technology in the English classroom and your intended audience was the board of a local high school, you might consider the following:
                - New learning possibilities for students (General Audience Concerns)
                - The necessity of modern technology in finding new, up-to-date information (Hook/Kairos)
                - Detailed narrative of how technology in one school vastly improved student literacy (Hook/Pathos)¬†
                - Statistics showing a link between exposure to technology and rising trends in literacy (Hook/Logos)
                - Quotes from education and technology professors expressing an urgency for technology in English classrooms (Hook/Ethos) 
                    - [Examples](<Examples.md>) [rhetoric](<rhetoric.md>) [exordium](<exordium.md>) [introduction](<introduction.md>) [hook](<hook.md>)
                - Of course, you probably should not include all of these types of appeals in the opening section of your argument‚Äîif you do, you may end up with a boring, overlong introduction that doesn‚Äôt function well as a hook. Instead, consider using some of these points as evidence later on. Ask yourself:¬†What will be most important to my audience? What information will most likely result in the action I want to bring about?¬†Think about which appeal will work best to gain the attention of your intended audience and start there.

Why? Because their behavior is more sophisticated than their representation. You see, a soon as you understand that that is a wild thing to understand because it answers the question. For example, how can you have dreams that tell you things you don't know? You think? Well, how the hell can that possibly be your coming up with the damn dream? How can the dream tell you things you don't know or analogous? Li? How can people tell stories that contain information that they don't understand?

An image. But it can't articulate it. Well, why would we be any different? We aren't obviously because we're more complex than we understand.

                    - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Directing conversation about ideas in the form of [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) is the most efficient way for [ideas](<ideas.md>) and [trails of thought](<trails of thought.md>) to persist through time.
                        - [Conventions](<Conventions.md>) [conversation](<conversation.md>) should be conducted in the form of [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) notes whenever possible to facilitate the  development of ideas through time.
                    - How I see this flowing: [Processes](<Processes.md>) [*]([fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>)) [*]([evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>))
                        1. Users document ideas as [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>) (low filter for creation)
                            - Approach: Phrase your idea as a claim, that could be supported, challenged, or elaborated on. Accuracy doesn't matter too much here.
                        2.  Users **continue the conversation** of these notes by [referencing]([block referencing](<block referencing.md>)) them in discussion, and formulating new [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>) in response to them.
                            - This may be an opportunity to use principles of [logic](<logic.md>) and [rhetoric](<rhetoric.md>), but these conventions would be [optional](<optional.md>).
                        3. Repeat [ad infinitum](<ad infinitum.md>) until ideas have been exhausted and writing becomes less [fruitful](<fruitful.md>). 
                        4. Development and [maturation](<maturation.md>) of ideas in [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) could be facilitated by [active or passive resurfacing]([[[E:](<[[E:.md>) active vs passive resurfacing]]).
                        5. As ideas become heavily referenced, or feel "[evergreen](<evergreen.md>)" in nature ‚Äî¬†a page should be created and an [evergreen note]([evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>)) formed.
                            - **[Related](<Related.md>):** [The stages of [[maturation](<The stages of [[maturation.md>) of [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) notes]] [Seedlings](<Seedlings.md>)

            - Brandon and I were discussing structures for Evergreen note pages earlier...
                - I would propose there is a way to simply and implicitly distinguish between an Evergreen that is ready to be a page and one that isn't
                    - For the most part, I think this has to do with the level of development of the necessary support and context
                    - A novel idea, combining across various pieces of literature and fleeting notes is an evergreen thought
                        - However, to efficiently transit it to others, it needs to be more than a page title ‚Äî you have to flesh it out
                - So, the approach I use is as follows
                    - As I read (and generally move through life) I collect [literature notes](<literature notes.md>) and [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>)
                        - At some point, an [evergreen](<evergreen.md>) thought will precipitate out of these
                    - I will then define this evergreen thought quite simply in Roam at the block level
                        - [Evergreens](<Evergreens.md>) Evergreen notes require detail and context to ensure they are readily communicable to either your future-self or to others
                        - I may add a block reference (or two) below it, but this is no where near fully developed
                    - Once I am ready to develop it sooner, I will create an identical `[E:](<E:.md>)` page for the Evergreen
                        - [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen notes require detail and context to ensure they are readily communicable to either your future-self or to others]]
                    - Then I will physically move the [Evergreen block](((Zcd1kPIXX))) into the Evergreen page, detail out the note, and add references and other supporting elements
                        - Note: I will add a block reference to the `[E:](<E:.md>)` page and then use the "Replace With > Original > Bring Nested Children" ‚Äî doing so ensure that I can easily see where I originally created the note (the earliest daily note page)
                    - How this implicitly determines the maturity of a now it it is easy to query for Evergreens that are now nested within an E page
                        - [minimal](<minimal.md>) {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Evergreens](<Evergreens.md>) {not: {or: [E:](<E:.md>) [roam/css](<roam/css.md>)}} }}}
                    - A bit convoluted, but it accomplishes a few things...
                        - Gives me the ability to search for an Evergreen using both `[[]]` and `(())` searches
                        - Implicitly defines maturity
                        - When building an outline, I always use Evergreen block references ‚Äî I can easily pull in the context by using the "Apply Children" function
                - I should probably just post a loom narrating this approach ‚Äî maybe tomorrow...
                - As an example I converted this Evergreen from Andy Matuschak into the format outlined above
                    - "[Evergreens](<Evergreens.md>) Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims"
                        - "When writing¬†[Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), I‚Äôve found that using complete phrases as note titles helps maintain concept-orientation ([Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF)).

                        - "These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body. If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that‚Äôs often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics (contra¬†[Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1)). In both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first."
                        - "Questions also make good note titles because that position creates pressure to make the question get to the core of the matter. Some questions really are evergreen ([To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6Ndn5nmxLWsrQQ3ZLHsxHsokGTycgo17XGYi)); others are more ephemeral creative prompts ([How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z57S2Fte6gAnnM1gCS2nHpH7NYAiXD8KeDfvZ)). The goal with the latter type of note is to eventually drop the question mark, refactoring it into declarative/imperative notes."

        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Going through conventions I thought that the [explanations ](((OrJE8GXKu)))should be distributed under each convention. In case the number of conventions would extend this would give them more structure.

        - According to the [definition](((o2aZIL3oU))) of [seedlings](<seedlings.md>) and the [context](((8zuNrwoHM))) on how it‚Äôs used from [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>), these seedling note should have higher priority to [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>) via prompts.
        - "[Annotations](<Annotations.md>) of [Toulmin Argument](<Toulmin Argument.md>) on [Purdue Online Writing Lab](<Purdue Online Writing Lab.md>) [*]([^[[leekeifon](<^[[leekeifon.md>)]]) [*]([cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]])" [^[[leekeifon](<^[[leekeifon.md>)]]
    - #[Conversation](<Conversation.md>)
        - [This method](((5NLcwZHoo))) thoroughly discuss how to make a smooth yet reliable way to develop deep thoughts across time and I will no doubt adapting this into my own database!  #[procedural knowledge](<procedural knowledge.md>) [*]([cc:[[Brandon Toner](<cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]])[*]([cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]])
            - This method agree with most of my previous thoughts, eg. [view page as resource](((3SbDzgrZF))), [treat page as truth](((ZZWmGCw0B))), as it builds up a intermediate state that help us slow down the speed on creating too much page, which is actually increasing the complexity of our database.
            - Also, the user experience for block auto-completion with a `[Evergreen](<Evergreen.md>)` tag at the front is almost the same as page auto-completion.
            - In other words, I vote for this procedure. (But I don‚Äôt know how to add an emoji to it in iPad...)

        - Would like to add a detail on [this step](((wL9FWsYpE))) of the the [new process](((X8fzypdUg))). [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
            - When referencing a fleeting note, we‚Äôd better assign a property along with it. Concretely speaking, that‚Äôs a way to indicate the relationship between blocks which would benefit us in the future. One idea that I‚Äôve alway thought of is that we could automatically label inner reference link with such properties in a graph view, and we could do better sense on the [maturity](<maturity.md>) of the idea.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** Just like this [set of tags](((dlHi_aDut))) when we‚Äôre clarifying a concept between each other‚Äôs.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** 
Just think of that we have a plugin ((maybe I will write it out in the near future)), and when we press some key, it will automatically retrieve all the reference blocks and link them in a graph view ((technically a pop up iframe)), which is a substructure of the block within the database. 

**AND**, if we have a set of properties assigned to them when doing references between blocks, then we can label the link automatically when generating the graph.

Then, We could also filter out certain properties to lower the complexity of the substructure. It should help us human do a better logical inference, but not machines.
reply to [this](((R8sUuPhbz))).
        - We should definitely start up an event, sharing our ideas on [[[R:](<[[R:.md>) How to write good prompts]] by reading about [Andy Matuschak](<Andy Matuschak.md>)‚Äôs origin one! [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
        - Seems that alias don‚Äôt work well with query? I find that your mentioning [here](((YLeWbqa5w))) I can‚Äôt query out, you could check out my personal page to confirm this. [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] #[Help Wanted](<Help Wanted.md>)
            - Yeah, these one works, but I still can‚Äôt find this [one](((YLeWbqa5w)))... A little bit tricky.
