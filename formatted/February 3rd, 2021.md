        3. Charles on ["N"-notes](<"N"-notes.md>) vs [seedlings](<seedlings.md>) [maturity](<maturity.md>)
            - "[Q](<Q.md>) What differentiates ["N"-notes](<"N"-notes.md>) and [seedlings](<seedlings.md>)?"
                - Seedlings are more "on the path towards" evergreen. 
                - Fleeting notes are more chaotic, a bit less polished and concise.
                - The objective difference I would propose would be page-status. [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]
                    - Fleeting note becomes a seedling when it becomes a page.
                        - Intermediary step before acquiring the `[E:](<E:.md>)` namespace and `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` tag.
                            - Same template as EN, but with `[Seedlings](<Seedlings.md>)` instead of `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)`
        4. #[Follow Up](<Follow Up.md>) "Re: [How To pages](((mMz7pLfVD))) [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [^[[Peter Rosso](<^[[Peter Rosso.md>)]] ‚Äî I like the distinction, we can block reference out internal documentation where relevant in the How To pages ‚Äî internal essentially being a subset  "
            - Don't quite understand this yet. Circle back.
        5. Keifon on Roam Games as a short-term goal
            - "Why not consider current [Roam Games](<Roam Games.md>) as a little short term goal for practicing our system towards a more robust system? It would be interesting! [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
                - Yea, great idea -- though I have limited bandwidth until mid next week...
                - I'll keep an eye on conversation if you want to keep riffing on it! By in large, I'm playing a long-term game with this project, but love the idea of [sprints](<sprints.md>). Hopefully, I'll be able to carve out some time to keep up with it. But the beauty of the graph is based on the conventions, information should accumulate in a way that transcends time-alignment. 
        6. Keifon on verbatim notes
            - "#[I](<I.md>) For [verbatim notes](<verbatim notes.md>), I think we could add a feature on it, that‚Äôs to help check the similarities of its content in the database and showing us who else is referring/quoting similar stuff. [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]]"
                - Yea, based on the block refs to original source, should usually be able to trace back informally. Not sure how to do that systematically though... besides keeping and eye on block refs?
        7. Keifon on async communication 
            - "#[Q](<Q.md>) What‚Äôs the best practice for async communication? [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"

        8. Dhrumil on potential Roam features / designs
            - [Custom [[Roam](<Custom [[Roam.md>) /-Menu Which Grows with the User's Skill Level]] [@[[Dhrumil Shah](<@[[Dhrumil Shah.md>)]]
                - Love [this](((g9GWQVxNJ))) idea
                    - Agree that more advanced users hardly use the slash menu, but I bet they would if it were suited to their growing need (extensions, shortcuts, etc)[*](((WxUPWq2y7)))
            - Seems like the sparkle would run it's course quite quickly! [*](((PVKEH1V7X)))
                - Doesn't take long to at least *see* features. But it takes a while to totally grok them.
            - Lots of great stuff in those notes -- I've bookmarked to return at some point.
        9. Larissa on a new shortcuts menu

                - Love it! Gonna do this right away. How do I get those dash dividers?? [~[[Larissa de Lima](<~[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]]
        10. Larissa's Questions:
            - "Questions I have:  "
                - All great questions! Every one of these disambiguations are on my mind...
                    - "They seem minor and I don't want to clutter the tag when there are more meaty questions at higher level of abstraction"
                        - I think yes. The meatier ones get escalated to page-level. (hasn't happened yet to my knowledge)
                    - "[Q](<Q.md>) When to use personal DNP vs. Roam Collective one"
                        - Personal = most
                        - Send a copy to the top RC one to make it more central. My vision is that the top section serves as a first place to look in the graph for the day. And memorializes highlights over time a bit better. I particularly like The Main Feed.
                            - Anyone can put stuff here.

                    - "[Q](<Q.md>) When to use feedback vs. pose a question"
                        - Feedback is more for general themes and feelings about what is going well and what could be improved. 
                            - There is some overlap that needs to be ironed out....
                            - Examples
                                - "Love this (X) convention"
                                - "Suprised how well X is working"
                                - "Feeling confused about when to X... where to put Y"
                                - Actual example [here](#[[[Feedback](<[[Feedback.md>): What's working]])
                            - Maybe Feedback is more reflective in tone? But maybe that should be something named differently. [~[[Larissa de Lima](<~[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]]
                                - Some overlap with how I've been experimenting with Observations.
                            - Maybe "Reflections" is best?
                    - "[Q](<Q.md>) When to use üì® vs. üö® ?"
                        - I've been treating @ as closer to "response requested" and cc as "you don't really need to respond, but may want to see this".
                            - A bit fuzzy still for me.
        11. On Peter's CSS Bootcamp:
            - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I have been doing a CSS bootcamp over the the last few days, so I hope you don't mind I cc'd myself here: "^^Interested in best ways to organize this part.^^ **Open to edits/suggestions.** [~[[Matthew Vogel](<~[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]] [cc:[[Peter Rosso](<cc:[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]""
                - Heck ya! This is a great place to put that bootcamp to work
        12. On maturity for different notes
            - "Does each note type need multiple level of maturity?"
                - **[Thoughts](<Thoughts.md>):** [^[[Charles Farr](<^[[Charles Farr.md>)]]
                    - Fleeting -- nah
                    - Literature -- also nah
                        - Unless maybe a group of literature notes matured into a summary of the content... (but that feels more analogous to [creative projects](<creative projects.md>) (loss of atomicity))
                    - Evergreen -- yes
                    - Evergreen Q's (whatever they are called) -- yes
            - "Does using a mythology popular elsewhere (seedling ‚Üí budding ‚Üí evergreen) muddy the waters?"
                - I don't think so! I like that metaphor quite a bit, and it's still in keeping with how others are using it... mostly. 
                - I'd say it works.
                - My challenge with "budding" is that it's hard to put objective boundaries on... when is something not growing? No longer a work in progress? [^[[Charles Farr](<^[[Charles Farr.md>)]] [~[[Larissa de Lima](<~[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]]
        13. On [filtering](<filtering.md>) over querying
            - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] what benefit do you see for filtering a page using [OR](<OR.md>) instead of constructing a regular [query](<query.md>) ? 
`{{[query](<query.md>): {or: [ex-B](<ex-B.md>) [ex-C](<ex-C.md>)}}}`"
                - Filtering is easier to do "on-the-fly". I like queries for standing searches, but I like to mess around in the filtering sections to "play" with the data a bit. [~[[Matthew Vogel](<~[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]]
                    - I find it harder to "play" with queries. 
        14. On namespaces
            - "I uses namespaces extensively in my personal graph since I know they'll be useful in the future but at this moment in Roam they're cosmetic. You can't query for them without [datalog](<datalog.md>) . Right now it feels like page references in the page name work alright but I often end up duplicating the page reference under a [Tags](<Tags.md>) attribute so who knows lol "

            - [x] tweets from [Conor](<Conor.md>) about the challenge
                - issues with help component 
                    - How do I see which version of Roam I am on
                    - Also seems you can't find the link to help db, or help videos either
                - 1. Design/UX of a in-app tutorial and onboarding component
-- could be Figma files, A roam graph with css hackery, whatever
                - 2. Editorial -- Videos, Examples, Text, Images that should go in there.
                - To that end, we will be judging not just on the work you put forward - but how the [intermediate deliverables](<intermediate deliverables.md>) you share along the way inspire others -- how you help to grow the commons, and inspire others in the roamcult faithful.. what others build on your foundation....
                - So - if you are entering into this challenge - then - along with your submission - we encourage you to cite (via quote tweet, or link out) the people whose work inspired you or you built on.

If you win, everyone you cited, and everyone who cited you, will share in your reward.
                - I get the idea of being specific so people get a sense of direction, yet participating with other projects we come up with is allowed? -> free play mode. 
                    - answered by conor: yeah exactly 
                - What are the most common problems (or questions) that people face when they start using Roam?

                    - Making it better is the new compressed [[RoamGames](<RoamGames.md>)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoamGames?src=hashtag_click) Challenge.

Kinda think you and all the folks you included in your tutorial component should be entered by default
                - One of the big goals of the games is to get designers jamming the same way the coders are
                - Roam42 does two things

First 
@roamhacker
 curated their favorite videos into a floating component you can access with a keyboard shortcut -- so you don't have to leave Roam to learn how to use Roam.
                    - i like the idea of having like a fast search of features and xparser compoenents and whatnot. maybe even the roam depot eventually.
                        - you can expand it to get an iframe of an external roam page which is just like a playground where shit doesnt get saved (or maybe this is in your own roam?) and you can just play around with the thing
                        - hopefully even use the search path component to then pull it into your current graph
                        -  curated their favorite videos into a floating component you can access with a keyboard shortcut -- so you don't have to leave Roam to learn how to use Roam. [*](((8Lg8CmObv)))
                        - toggle to add things to slash command menu menu?
                        - ^^what if in docs, each feature comes with the slider thing so you can view how diffferent people describe taht same feature or use it in different ways? when you add it your thing to the slider, other people in your graph can see it? so the graph lead explains how to use each feature to the rest of the members?^^ hence its not FULLY playground like i previously predicted
                            - same thing applies in search? what if when you do collaborative search in a team, people can playground up the thing they're reading and save it as that so the other people in the team see that? nah, just use forked pages
                            - problems are:
                                - if this page is in help db for example, then your changes (even added versions) won't actually save to it
                                - if this is a page in your graph, then like how will roam write to it and update it over time without accessing your graph? ^^@hoshuaang's feed thing would work IF you could add versions from your graph that were only visible in your graph or something. so it's one-way stream where you can read the incoming stuff and you can play around with as a playground but it wont save state. to save your playground, create a version for that block and the versions are only visible in your graph.^^
                - Second - they built a searchable list of all the commands - with some descriptions about how to use them -- also available via dropdown or keyboard shortcut.


                    - this is what the current thing is i think
                - We're giving 10k to folks who give us suggestions we use to improve our in-app tutorials.

Design, Copy, Examples, Workflows, UX, Curation of great stuff that's in the community already - whatever.

We hope to call out chains of influence - so awards go to all linked ideas.
            - [x] checking out all public twitter stuff for roam games hastag since yesterday
                - @zsviczian's stuff - for last challenge
                - @anirudhbadri stuff - long thread so that's nice. to be honest, not really on the same page with the wizard stuff, but maybe there's a version of this that contributes to what [Feels Right](<Feels Right.md>)
                    - Idea: Have an 'Onboarding Wizard' that asks users some basic questions, uses the responses to set up plugins and recommend tutorials APPROPRIATELY
                    - I'll get to how, but first why this approach? 
We have a[DesignProblem: There are so many awesome tools, plugins and tutorials. We want to avoid overwhelming new users with them
Also, we don't want to generate content, we want to maximally leverage RoamCult  content
                    - Each user has their own use case for Roam, and the toolkit that would give them 80% of their use case also varies. For example, a journaler needs advanced date manipulation, a designer NEEDS customisable CSS and fancy themes etc. The onboarding goal is to map users to resources!
                    - Put differently, the goal of the wizard is to find the minimum feature-set to give EACH user such that they see the magic and are all-set for at least 80% of their use case?
                    - So what questions do we need to ask?
1) Familiarity with networked thought tools (using other note taking tools doesnt help much UNLESS they want to use Roam to take notes)
2) Coding background
3)What their use case for [@RoamResearch](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch)
The Wizard would ask relevant follow ups
                    - Note that Wizard here is an abstraction above the particular implementation. The UI can be a chatbot, a questionnaire or even 'AI' that deduces use case from letting the user play in a sandbox
                        - seems somewhat related to the [GPT-3](<GPT-3.md>) stuff [Taylor Rogalski](<Taylor Rogalski.md>) talked about before
                    - So what would it do? Well, initially we'd have some static subsets of users. [https://twitter.com/tracyplaces/status/1356670295168454656?s=19‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/tracyplaces/status/1356670295168454656?s=19)
The learnings from the approach here can be distilled into 'feature sets', the plugins that most of the users in the subset NEED, and 'tutorial sets' which the Wizard would serve
                    - The intention is to divorce content creation AND curation from the onboarding 'process', so that this can remain untouched even during massive overhauls of implementation. Also incentivises the best content makers for each niche to focus on helping their audience
                    - [@roamhacker](https://twitter.com/roamhacker)'s Help bar is an excellent model to think of how the Wizard can help on an ongoing basis. Imagine just filtering the community content based on what others working on the same use case have reported as useful. 

Also, switching to a different use case is just a Toggle
                    - And if the new user wants a personal onboarding experience, like so: https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1356601657807704065?s=19

The wizard can point them to 'use case' related experts who would offer (paid) half an hour sessions to get the user set up.  We want to build a Knowledge Economy as well, don't we?
                - [@tracyplaces](https://twitter.com/tracyplaces) - not feeling the use cases part. But hmm, tangential thought --- what if you can like connect your twitter or something to your roam. then people can search for twitter people they like that have roam, and send request to check out there roam? idk, but some shit along the lines of... how tf does team roam actually use roam would be interesting. idk if this can be pulled off in any way thats not like hella annoying for the graph owners tho. OnlyGraphs lol. [Robert Haisfield](<Robert Haisfield.md>) hosts these roam tour videos which are great, i've emulated a lot of my process using Beau Haan and [Joel Chan](<Joel Chan.md>). What if Roam Depot was less like home depot and more like some medieval-aesthetic public market with a lot of color and movement? People could go on there and yell for what they want (like which usecase) and others could comment underneath how to go about it by linking to existing people implementing that.
                    - > Fundamental question for beginners: Where do you want Roam to take you?

Select from a roadmap of use cases, users, and uber-niche groups who can serve as guides to existing content. 

Conversations then help us develop new onboarding content based on common questions.
                - [@z9sx7wox](https://twitter.com/z9sx7wox) - there's a ton of focus on onboarding centering around use cases, even in those threads above^. To be honest, I'm not on the same page here, it feels like a cop-out.
                    - So a simple way of handling this is having us figure out what these use cases are that invite someone to fold in [@RoamResearch](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch)  into their life.

What are they?
                    - From there you can do a bunch of things 1) a simple button at the top of the screen that is a (?) - a help icon. - that shows up if (someone's graph has) < (# pages ) OR (# blocks) - this shows you it's a "fresh" graph
                    - this button can be what triggers the onboarding - start it off with a high contrast color in the ecosystem
                    - the onboarding can be a choose your own adventure type of thing - the adventures you can choose from are use cases that the Roam team (and [[roamcult](<roamcult.md>)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult?src=hashtag_click)) have identified.

Below are some of these use cases + good tutorials 4 them (I invite you to post links that you've found useful)
                - [@houshuang](https://twitter.com/houshuang) cross-graph conversation engine and feeds. those are cool. fits with the pattern of not having to leave your roam to learn how to use roam - his change log example in particular.
                - I totally need to speak to [Robert Haisfield](<Robert Haisfield.md>) soon... conversing with him was one of the best things i did during my fellowship cycle. he totally needs to get paid from these games considering how much he contributes to the commons.
                - [@houshuang](https://twitter.com/houshuang)  suggested [[[Prior Work](<[[Prior Work.md>): RemNote]].. gonna check it out -- i like the way these tutorials are done actually... maybe useful to do them for the CORE features.
                    - [Gtoolkit](<Gtoolkit.md>) is somewhat similar to [[[Prior Work](<[[Prior Work.md>): RemNote]] in terms of onboarding

            - [x] going to search twitter and some personal websites for stuff on onboarding
                - hackernews - cant see anything good
                - some designers on twitter who have related stuff
                    - [x] Obviously [Robert Haisfield](<Robert Haisfield.md>)  lol, probably the go-to person for this
                        - He gives a very great overview of the actual core problems in onboarding. stuff like continuous onboarding, user goals change as their skills do, how do you help them imagine goals they dont even know yet (this is especially true with roam), etc. These questions would honestly take a couple of months to make progress on. Outside of the scope of this project due to time limits. but i'll point in future research suggestions as this is legit.
                        - > being aware of the features generally means you‚Äôll be aware of when you should learn it to accomplish a new goal.

Due to principles of Difficulty Matching, we know that if we ask a user to learn something too advanced early in, they will likely get frustrated and give up. This is a common problem with Notion and Roam users: they see people using the applications in advanced ways near the beginning of their experience and they think that they have to implement everything right from the start.

These users would have far better outcomes if they simply operated at or slightly above their skill level to accomplish their current goals, but were aware of what could help them accomplish their future goals so they know what they can learn when those goals arise.
                            - honestly, this greatly supports the sparkle you see as you go through public roams and unseen features.

                        - > progressively reveals information as the user develops so they are always becoming more effective users. Even through behavioral tracking, it can be challenging for the app to recognize exactly what the user wants to learn at any given point. This means that there has to be a solid framework for exploratory search, where the user can find what they are looking for on their own or with the help of other users.

                            - this is when something like the "@anirudhbadri stuff - long thread so that's nice. to be honest, not really on the same page with the wizard stuff, but maybe there's a version of this that contributes to what [Feels Right](<Feels Right.md>)" could be useful to be honest

                            - > - ^^The app can only be so intelligent in recognizing when a user could learn something new.^^
    - The app can react to certain behavioral signals coming from the user:
        - user behavior could signal that the user is trying to do something in an inefficient way
        - user behavior could signal that the user has progressed to a skill level that's necessary to learn a more advanced technique
    - ^^The app can react to declared preferences and clearly expressed **user goals.**^^
        - The user could do a search for information. This requires the user to at least have at least a fuzzy idea of what they are looking for.
        - The user can describe to the app in some way what their goals are. This can come from "Questions during the onboarding".

@AdamMarblestone
 and I have the exact same vision: we need to *integrate* into existing infrastructure and practices (including incentive systems).

Currently experimenting with integrations into journal clubs and new student onboarding.
                            - what if you just like upload a PDF and start taking highlights, like the extension, and see the links+buttons in the highlights that show up
                                - it's like you're starting to use roam because you want a great pdf experience, and that serves as an entry point into like eventually learning the entire thing

                            - [>](<>.md>) Digital products are all about getting to the destination. As long as the destination proves valuable, users are more than willing to forgive a terrible journey. But this isn‚Äôt so for games, as¬†**games deliver the value through the journey, rather than the destination.**¬†In other words, the best of the endings won‚Äôt save a game with a mediocre playing experience.
                                - true for roam too
                            - [>](<>.md>) It‚Äôs ok to teach users, as long as they don‚Äôt notice. The trick is to make the process feel more like a discovery and less like work. As a rule of thumb, you should try to avoid holding the user‚Äôs hand, but if you have to hold it, try to hide it from them.
                            - [>](<>.md>) Alright, we are still stuck in the room so let‚Äôs get out of here. Notice how focused the UI is, displaying nothing but a couple of basic controls. There are no interrupting dialogs telling users how to do things, just the minimum amount of information needed to get to the next step.

After all, it would be nearly impossible for anyone to master all 20 control available in such a short time. This is known as progressive disclosure and it serves a two-fold purpose.

                            - [>](<>.md>) When everything is new and unfamiliar, users feel uncomfortable. It‚Äôs a natural response. To help users navigate the unknown, you must help them feel safe. Nintendo knows this, that‚Äôs why they have players start the game inside a cave.
Why a cave? Because it‚Äôs a familiar metaphor. Users know what to expect: if we are inside, we must go out. It‚Äôs also easy to navigate and has none of the distractions of the infinite outdoors. Moreover, the cave‚Äôs boundaries reassure users that enemies won‚Äôt sneak up on them. When combined, all these contribute to help players feel safe.
A way for you to provide a safe place for users is to onboard them with a demo or tutorial document. The trick is to make it feel disposable. This encourages users to experiment. After all, who cares if you break a demo document?
                                - yeah so make the help thing a playground where you can test stuff around and not mess up the actual graphs. use same principle in the modals that show up (which could just be the help screen actually) when you click sparkle
                            - [>](<>.md>) When you use demo documents in your onboarding, don‚Äôt forget to give users something to do. This will free them from thinking about what to do next, allowing them to focus on completing the task. And if you are up for some extra points, give them something unfinished they can complete.

                    - Once Roam Multiplayer exists, onboarding will be dramatically more enjoyable. ((30QXYkryL)) would essentially be a web that you can browse consisting of all the graphs you have access to. New users can simply browse around public graphs, just like they do in the existing web, and click on an interesting block to see its "code" or [Indicator on [[Roam](<Indicator on [[Roam.md>) Blocks Using Never-Before-Seen X-Parser Components or Templates]] to see its documentation.

                    - In ((30QXYkryL)), read only graphs are essentially playgrounds where the user can move things around and write stuff as they wish. Of course, none of it will actually be saved. To keep their modifications, the user must fork the read only graph or send the blocks to a graph they can edit.

                        - with roam web, you can treat stuff as a playground without worrying about it saving in readonly, and can click on blocks to see their source code so you can reproduce stuff you see

                    - Search bar on top and navigation bar on sides just like currently. This supports shortcuts for now, but could end up supporting native x-parser components and templates as well. Roam Depot documentation for components and templates could also be accessible from here, albeit not emphasized as greatly. Clicking on [Indicator on [[Roam](<Indicator on [[Roam.md>) Blocks Using Never-Before-Seen X-Parser Components or Templates]] would open this and jump to the appropriate documentation. Each x-parser component has a toggle allowing it to be shown or hidden from `/-menu`.
                    - Each item has a button called `Explore`  which is revealed on hover. Clicking it reveals a wrapped Roam documentation block which can be treated as a playground to try the feature out. [Stian H√•klev](<Stian H√•klev.md>)'s demonstrates [*](((jXB7xuRDM))) how this block can be pulled from the Roam Help Graph. The challenge is that you would have to be able to add versions from your graph that were saved. The Roam Help Database is only a playground environment so you can't actually write to it. **The ideal scenario seems to be such that you can subscribe to the documentation block for a feature from the Roam Help Database and also create versions for that block only visible from your graph. **The documentation block would include:
                        - video (or playlist)

                        - This block can be versioned by anyone in the graph. For example, the admin might choose to version the block and add their own documentation on how to use it for their purposes.

            - [Robert Haisfield](<Robert Haisfield.md>)'s website https://robhaisfield.com has some GREAT questions on [Onboarding](<Onboarding.md>) and provides an overview of the challenges which make it a tricky problem for Roam. Unfortunately tackling these questions was outside of the scope of this evening as it would take a couple of months to get right. Maybe this servers as inspiration for an ambitious Roaman? Here's a preview of some great quotes on the subject from his website:
                - "> being aware of the features generally means you‚Äôll be aware of when you should learn it to accomplish a new goal.

Due to principles of Difficulty Matching, we know that if we ask a user to learn something too advanced early in, they will likely get frustrated and give up. This is a common problem with Notion and Roam users: they see people using the applications in advanced ways near the beginning of their experience and they think that they have to implement everything right from the start.

These users would have far better outcomes if they simply operated at or slightly above their skill level to accomplish their current goals, but were aware of what could help them accomplish their future goals so they know what they can learn when those goals arise."

    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>)
        - On graph visual organization, layout, and design
            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] re: "^^Interested in best ways to organize this part.^^ **Open to edits/suggestions.** [~[[Matthew Vogel](<~[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]] [cc:[[Peter Rosso](<cc:[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]"
                - Completely agree that the graph [Beau Hann](<Beau Hann.md>) pullled together for RBC3 looks incredibly clean ‚Äî something to emulate.
                - My belief is that any design revisions essentially fall into two buckets:
                    - 1) Updates to increase internal clarity of purpose
                    - 2) Packaging to enable easily access by external participants
                - On "1) Updates to increase internal clarity of purpose", the following tasks seem like good starting places
                    - Select a color scheme that we want to go with and build in standardized color variables
                        - "[Q](<Q.md>) Can Roam Collective develop a color scheme that better supports our key mission?"
                    - Rationalize down the number of tags we have a current (design has been divergent, time to converge a bit)
                    - Develop a visual language that has implied meaning
                        - For instance...
                            - All section-level tags have a background (e.g., [Conversation](<Conversation.md>))
                            - All block-level tags are bolded and add a `:` at the end (e.g., formatting like `#[Q](<Q.md>) like [Evergreen](<Evergreen.md>))
                            - Aligning color palettes with specific tag groupings (e.g., all DNP modules tags are shades of blue while notes are shades green (spitballing here))
                    - Create some "dashboard" pages that aggregate specific tags (e.g., a layout that makes it easy to see the latest Questions, or Questions that have been answered, etc.)
                - On "2) Packaging to enable easily access by external participants"
                    - This is where we can really lean into a similar approach to the RBC ‚Äî minimalistic, use of more hierarchical design (e.g,, tables of contents, headers, footers, embeds)
        - On disentangling note types & note [maturity](<maturity.md>)
            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I've been thinking about this all day and I think that we should disentangle note type and maturity status
                - Below, the lowest level of maturity is any type of note at the block level, then move up from there through levels of maturity after transclusion to a page
                    - Questions:
                        - Does each note type need multiple level of maturity?
                            - If so, should the levels of maturity be the same across note type?
                        - What is the right scale for maturity?
                            - Does using a mythology popular elsewhere (seedling ‚Üí budding ‚Üí evergreen) muddy the waters?

        - #[N](<N.md>) Scoping is a key step for prioritization and getting things done
            - Think this is also very tied to GTD philosophy
            - The proliferation of new content in Roam creates two key challenges

            - "I think yes. The meatier ones get escalated to page-level. (hasn't happened yet to my knowledge)"
                - Challenge identified:  having many instances of a tag slows Roam when going navigating by scrolling through linked references
                    - Does this happen to anyone else?  Any solutions?  
                    - I have found this to be the case as well with my personal graph - it gets to a point where there are so many instances of a specific tag that I can no longer navigate through the linked references.  However, it's still clearly super useful for have the tag for querying
                - So this came up because I was going to go through questions to escalate some to page-level.  
                    - My process was to go through the questions and then organize/indent them, as a way to then decide what should be grouped/escalated, as well as provide a comprehensive view to allow for scoping/convergence (see ""Time for some [CONVERGENCE]([convergence](<convergence.md>)) ‚Äî **Questions**" üõ† Categorizing questions: ")
                        - Anyways, that was the dream. 
                        - The problem became every time I try going through the Q linked references, it gets so so slow that there is a good 3-4 second delay for every letter I type.  Basically, becomes unworkable
                            - For the specific challenge, I have now talked myself into a possible solution - I can just break the questions down by querying by day - that will probably make it more manageable. 
                            - However, the broader question remains
            - "PPV?"
                - What is PPV?

                    - I support this!! 
            - Support for Weekly Reviews idea by PRosso
                - "[Everyone](<Everyone.md>) do we have weekly and monthly reviews which can be used as structured ways to force convergence?

                - My RBC3 graph is not loading at the moment to check what they do, but I have seen in other graphs it being done "brute force" rather than CSS, by having a page titled "-------------" üòÇ  It works though!
            - [@[[Dhrumil Shah](<@[[Dhrumil Shah.md>)]] lots of really interesting stuff - would you love to learn more about what's in the background in your mind, bigger picture motivation, so I can better contextualize in my own mind how to understand
                - Actually, reading the notes in reverse (starting with design inspiration) helped me a ton in understanding.   
        - On defining [norms](<norms.md>) and best practices -> with conclusions + draft output
            - [Q](<Q.md>) Should we have a page that collects decisions/latest thinking on best practices for norms, that expands on "where to write"? or perhaps extends the FAQ?

                    - Awesome! Pulled something together here: "Draft version of [norms](<norms.md>) (for my own personal ease of reference)"
                - It could include, for example, this norm:
                    -   "[I](<I.md>) Charles' convention for the conversation section might actually be best practice for the scratchpad as well! [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]"

                    - [Q](<Q.md>) When to use personal DNP vs. Roam Collective one
                        - "Kinda like [this](((j0l9zU-q-)))"

                    - [Q](<Q.md>) When to use feedback vs. pose a question
                        - "Maybe "Reflections" is best?"  
                            - For me, the word "Reflections" doesn't clarify the distinction.  It seems like it's more a matter of norms - it seems like we are using questions to drive discussion about processes within Roam, and using the conversations to hash out the answers to those questions.
                            - So for something like  ""Suprised how well X is working"", would it be in conversations if something is actively being worked on, and in Feedback if not?
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) When to use üì® vs. üö® ?
                        - "A bit fuzzy still for me."
                            - Seems eminently sensible to me!
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) Should minor questions of clarifications also be tagged?  
                        - They seem minor and I don't want to clutter the tag when there are more meaty questions at higher level of abstraction
        - (low priority) On further exploring building "operationability" among atomic units and building blocks
            -  "[~[[Larissa de Lima](<~[[Larissa de Lima.md>)]] I am so curious now."
