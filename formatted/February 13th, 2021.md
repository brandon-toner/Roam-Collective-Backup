            - The greatest challenge is coming up with coherent, minimally overlapping classifications. [*]([[[E:](<[[E:.md>) mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE)]])

            - [Q](<Q.md>) What [classification](<classification.md>) systems, [taxonomies](<taxonomies.md>), or lists would be useful within Roam Collective?

            - [I](<I.md>) I would like to begin collecting classification systems. Mostly in my personal system, but many will apply here. 
                - This would look like a `[Classifications](<Classifications.md>)` tag, which serves as a parent to the `[Collections](<Collections.md>)` class of tags.
                    - A [classification](<classification.md>) is a set of collections that map a domain or system.
