            - [I](<I.md>) I would like to begin collecting classification systems. Mostly in my personal system, but many will apply here. 
                - This would look like a `[Classifications](<Classifications.md>)` tag, which serves as a parent to the `[Collections](<Collections.md>)` class of tags.

                        - This would also emphasize the importance of logging information in these places so that it is surfaced for inclusion of the weekly highlights.
                - This would help to keep Twitter and members of the graph apprised on events, updates and highlights.
                - This would also help to drive engagement for members, giving them a reminder and an easy jump-in point if they wanted to contribute some ideas.

            - Desired style:

            - Goal: Be able to adjust the dark grey at will easily.

                - We could map the dependencies similar to how we document [relevant notes](<relevant notes.md>) on ENs
                - Maybe there are some [prepositional linkages]([prepositional linkages](<prepositional linkages.md>)) that could be identified to connect the submissions
