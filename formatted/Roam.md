- This is THE REASON for creating a for mapping the [dependencies](<dependencies.md>) between ideas[*]([Epics/Managing knowledge dependencies in multiplayer](<Epics/Managing knowledge dependencies in multiplayer.md>)) and probably the [mission](<mission.md>) of [Roam](<Roam.md>).

## [February 8th, 2021](<February 8th, 2021.md>)
- In existing note-taking systems (e.g. [Evernote](<Evernote.md>)) the primary goal of tags is to create groups and collection of notes. It's different in [Roam](<Roam.md>),

- This is where I see [Roam](<Roam.md>)'

- #[N](<N.md>) Watching others use [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- One thing that has been clear with all the multiplayer graphs I have worked with, is that zooming in on the bullet/area you are working on CAN be helpful to allow [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- And what I wanted to say at the [Clubhouse](<Clubhouse.md>) meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- [Robert Haisfield](<Robert Haisfield.md>) on [structure](<structure.md>) in [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- **Property** of a [communication](<communication.md>) entity is **reachability**, in other words, anything in [Roam](<Roam.md>)

## [January 29th, 2021](<January 29th, 2021.md>)
- What are the steps of [project management](<project management.md>) generally? How could they be applied in [Roam](<Roam.md>)?

- #[N](<N.md>) A community centered around [screenshot essays](<screenshot essays.md>) and a daily [writing](<writing.md>) habit, nested within the [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [Mark Robertson](<Mark Robertson.md>) really show us the limitless possibility that what [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [Mark Robertson](<Mark Robertson.md>) really show us the limitless possibility that what [Roam](<Roam.md>) UI can achieve. In other words, we might set our mind free first before we’re trying to implement the UI system in [Roam](<Roam.md>).

- Maybe we could [model](<model.md>) our [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- Maybe it’s not necessarily to delete private messages actually, we could **just make it hard to find**, or hides behind the auto-complete list, but that maybe a job for [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- Maybe it’s not necessarily to delete private messages actually, we could **just make it hard to find**, or hides behind the auto-complete list, but that maybe a job for [Roam](<Roam.md>) team. For us, in order to create such a space, we may insert some encoded content into [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- One reward for Roaman with high reputation in Roam reputation system may be the permission to create new page? If we view [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- Maybe, we could view page as [truth](<truth.md>), in one [Roam](<Roam.md>) database, one [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- Both synchronous and async one is good. For now, I’m kind of lacking visions on how online events can be within [Roam](<Roam.md>).

- I mean, could we fulfill our online social need purely in [Roam](<Roam.md>),

## [January 30th, 2021](<January 30th, 2021.md>)
- [These](((CCODMMO6j))) were captured using [Memex](<Memex.md>). They have a [customizable](<customizable.md>) [copy-paster](<copy-paster.md>) that is excellent for getting information into [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- #[N](<N.md>) the benefits of having access to [verbatim](<verbatim.md>) passages offers an argument for being able to easily import [full-text](<full-text.md>) into [Roam](<Roam.md>).
