        - 06:06 conditioning or â€˜steelingâ€™ myself against [pain](<pain.md>) is numbing myself. iâ€™m better off â€˜feelingâ€™ the pain, accepting and embracing what it brings instead. after all iâ€™m in a relationship with experience and pain is a type of experience.
        - 06:46 today, i'm copy-pasting [Peter Rosso](<Peter Rosso.md>)'s template till i can figure out how to invoke it with a command
        - typing this with a [colemak](<colemak.md>) keyboard is frustrating and excruciatingly slow. on mobile i still use swipe to type, so i'm blisteringly fast, which makes this so much more frustrating
        - also clueless about the rest of the tags below but they are colorful and pretty
        - [with all due respect](<with all due respect.md>) 'why do people insist on staying their deference right before undercutting it with a mildly disrespectful provocation?' (quote from Blacklist)
        - thoughts on [movement](<movement.md>)
            - solo movement = masturbation
            - partner movement = sex
        - 22:12 can i gatecrash into other's daily notes and start riffing, taking off on a tangent or playing in tandem?
