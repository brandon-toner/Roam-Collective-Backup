        1. Last night I ([Charles]([Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>))) wrote about mythologies of notes â€” I would love to get **everyone's** thoughts on refactoring our current note structure â†’ see "Thinking on objectives and the relationship to mythology"
            - **Brandon:** This is a great summary of ideas, Charles. Still percolating my thoughts around it all, but have bookmarked it with Follow Up to continue to think it through. While foundational, I think we can maintain course as we have been until clarity strikes. [*]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]])
            - **Larissa:**  Strongly agree with "Mythologies are so often chosen based on the type of work we're trying to do" [*]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]])
                - Touches on the point re: what are the objectives?  Is it just to build a guide?  
                    - The reason I struggle with that is that tools and process for collaboration depend on the desired output.  Do we aim to create a guide that works for all types of collaboration?   
        2. Some outlines on [structure and process](((W8X67wb_G))) for Roam Collective
            - Purpose: 
                - Create some structure that can serve to keep us oriented and aligned.
                - A step towards building something to publish for the greater community.
            - Goal: Build out the outline through collective brainstorming (What's missing?)
            - Next: 
                - Use that outline to go a level deeper (outline each section).
                - Create documentation that reflects the content.
        3. **Goal:** [Refresh the FAQs and Prompts](((FfZu-AqGj)))
I think the FAQs could be a lot more relevant, and the Prompts more usable (maybe fewer, better ones?)
            - **Larissa:**  
                - Re: FAQs:  think we should add in [norms](((CaGPiJ2TS)))
                    - Personally, also love [this](((2iqWWvBph))) and would suggest adding it as a norm - as it also provides "permission" to suggest and improve wherever an opportunity is observed
                - Re: Prompts: should we have a process to connect the prompts and the set of [open questions](((rQhJBlEnm)))? and perhaps a process to mark questions as "resolved"?

    - [Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>) ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))
        - Yesterday I introduced [Multiplayer Roam](<Multiplayer Roam.md>) to a small group of ~10 people who had little to no experience with multiplayer graphs and it was heartening to see how excited it made them and what kinds of questions they had.
            - Questions included:
                1. Do I need to be a paying roam user to use a multiplayer graph?
                    - ie if they are not sold on Roam as a whole for personal use but want to contribute to a graph
                2. One member expressed a worry that being presented with such a 'blank canvas' would drive them to endlessly tweak the conventions and interface looking for the 'best' system
                    - I talked about light social pressure on a multiplayer graph; it's similar to not wanting to deface a shared common area for risk of adversely affecting your peers.
                    - Multiplayer graphs historically have been strong places of democratic process; ideas are presented and discussed before being made (__usually__)
                    - Strong conventions at the start hare a huge help. Potentially a short period at the start of the graph inception (2 days?) where fundamental conventions can be challenged.
            - There was a strong sense of being intimidated by multiplayer graphs, even by people with an understanding of Roam. Having small guided tours of the graph helped alleviate those worries. 
                - This is probably not possible with larger graphs but I could see it working very well with smaller ones
            - Being overwhelmed by the daily notes page was a common sentiment among the group.
                - I like the [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) III]] approach of putting daily notes on a person's personal page and leaving the daily notes page for group communication, [Prompts](<Prompts.md>), etc. 
                    - This put's everyone's notes in the references instead of directly on the daily notes
            - I was surprised how unexcited they were about searching across the graph for adjacent blocks using double brackets `(( ))`. My guess is that the true power of this isn't clear until you've experienced the serendipity yourself 
            - My instinct says we need to foster a strong sense of exploration with new members. Create â†’ Explore â†’ Engage â†’ Create
                - {{[diagram](<diagram.md>)}}
                    - Create
                    - Explore
                    - Engage
    - [Questions](<Questions.md>) ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) 
        - ~~Would a block creation leaderboard be fun or harmful? (ie top writers and block creators on a multiplayer graph)~~
            - This could turn the graph into more of a game similar to the Fitbit leaderboard. Could also be harmful pressure "My contribution is so small and not worth it"
                - It's hard to quantify the value of an idea. A single idea/block could spawn dozens of blocks. Hmm maybe blocks with the most refs...
    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>) 
        - Works for me! Thanks [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]! [*](((shPwbVEW0)))
        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Heads up I messed up a little when setting up the [Projects/Establish automated graph backups](<Projects/Establish automated graph backups.md>). Apparently using macOS to do the backups is expensive (1 run minute costs 10 minutes???). Live and learn! Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
            - A user gets 2000 free run minutes a month and mine are close to running out ðŸ˜¬. Check the repo for an incoming PR to fix this

            - [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]] Information overload is right! I'm in the same boat honestly. There's been an incredible amount writing and conventions developed in this graph so far. [*](((FqyiA2fgt)))

            - Interested in [Mat McGann](<Mat McGann.md>)'s work on collaborative Roaming. 
                - He has been running his business in Roam, with his team â€” as a collaborative graph. 
                - He published a database explaining these practices. More on that [here](https://twitter.com/matmcgann/status/1358416938129453062?s=21).

                            - Then reflect on how it could be more clear.

            - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] [*](((cxyHE-hYX))) It depends. On a day to day basis people should follow their own rhythms for maximal output. Though deadlines on output could require synchronous convergence."
                - Agreed. I think objectives and targets help to align individual work with collective goals. [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]
            - "Tweet referring to Conor ðŸ˜… [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
                - Great thread [cc:[[Peter Rosso](<cc:[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]. 
                - What were you big takeaways? 
                    - Seems like Conor/Roam have used systems similar to what we have in place here. 
                    - I think our notification are better than "the dropzone"
                    - Interesting to hear that Conor views multiplayer as aberration haha
            - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I started using an attribute â€” I hope I don't come to [regret](((xaNyqoEJT))) it lol"

                - Right now, my thought is to think as if things everything is fleeting â€” making links to promote eventual resurfacing in the right contexts.
                - While I love the idea of weekly/monthly reviews â€” I rarely have the discipline to actually follow through on them. 
                    - (I just may not be the one to lead it off, though â€” I def see value in reviews, just don't have the bandwidth for a more disciplined approach quite yet.)
                - Part of what I like about Roam is the ability to rely on things circulating back at the right time â€” a reliance on serendipity. 
                - This requires both some detachment and some faith in the magic junkyard lol.
                - I did some thinking on overall [structure and process](((W8X67wb_G))), and I think the next step is to start to build that out a bit to formalize it.
                - Once we get over this hurdle (defining structure and process), then we likely enter the phase of **engaging with** those processes, primarily knowledge development, and productivity (working on projects and outputs).
            - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] We can start [setting up the website](((m-bFHWp73))) either using a service like wordpress/squareplace or building one and hosting it on https://app.netlify.com/ for a start."

                - I don't think we're overboard. Most CSS adjustments have been little tweaks here and there. I think there is room left for more customization if we feel it helpful. Not scared of it. [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]]

            - "22:12 can i gatecrash into other's daily notes and start riffing, taking off on a tangent or playing in tandem?"
                - Absolutely! Just take a block reference of the part that catches your attention, paste it into your section â€” and nest all of your thoughts on that idea and beyond [@[[Reddy2Go](<@[[Reddy2Go.md>)]]
        4. On [GitHub](<GitHub.md>) minute budget
            - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Heads up I messed up a little when setting up the [Projects/Establish automated graph backups](<Projects/Establish automated graph backups.md>). Apparently using macOS to do the backups is expensive (1 run minute costs 10 minutes???). Live and learn! Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"

                    - I bought 1 month of premium last week to navigate an overage... but usage seems down since. I'll keep an eye as I enter next month. Thanks! [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]]

            - What became of it?  Is [this](((8_3jbANCb))) the last thread from Feb 4th?
        - On BToner's [structure and process](((W8X67wb_G)))
            - Worth thinking through time dimension across different process activities - as that can help think through whether/how diff steps in the process help with convergence vs. divergence 
                - e.g., when is purpose defined vs. revisited?  what about project creation vs. review?
        - Reading Mat McGann's [Multiplayer RoamBrain article](https://www.roambrain.com/nine-things-ive-learnt-from-running-my-distributed-startup-in-a-multiplayer-roam/) 
            - Key points of divergence
                - Recommends "context first" approach based on building out pages, with daily notes references used to provide overview of output

            - "#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Roam offers a [selection bias](<selection bias.md>) towards "gardeners" [*]([architects, gardeners, and librarians](<architects, gardeners, and librarians.md>))." [*]([@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) 
                - Wonder what informs that hypothesis for you  
                - My anecdotal evidence points to the opposite, with Roam the dream tool for architects, as it allows creation and co-existence of multiple structures to achieve simultaneously.

            - Agree with the need!  Still catching up on what I've missed in the last couple of days, so earmarking this to come back later once I've understood how it's been implemented
