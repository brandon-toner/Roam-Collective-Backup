- [x] "#[FN](<FN.md>) [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) are a great indicator of [signal](<signal.md>)

- [x] "#[FN](<FN.md>) Strategic and intentional use of [conventions](<conventions.md>), improves the ratio of [signal](<signal.md>)

- [Q](<Q.md>) How might bookmarks, or other surrogates for [signal](<signal.md>)

- #[FN](<FN.md>) To manage [chaos](<chaos.md>) in a [collaborative graph](<collaborative graph.md>) — aim to amplify [signal](<signal.md>),

- Taking all of the above into account, we can use the implicit distinct between [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) and [section tags](<section tags.md>) to help [parse](((AcVV2n11w))) out [signal](<signal.md>)

## [February 20th, 2021](<February 20th, 2021.md>)
- This would auto-compile ALL of the block-level tags used throughout the day by all users — and would be a great way to detect [signal](<signal.md>)
