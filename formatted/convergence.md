- A tag to use to tag "acts of convergence" â€” These are valuable efforts to prevent from [falling between the cracks](<falling between the cracks.md>). Could also name "Acts of Convergence" haha

- Continued building a directory of questions, as a first step on aggregating and prioritizing (for when we are ready for [convergence](<convergence.md>))

- My process was to go through the questions and then organize/indent them, as a way to then decide what should be grouped/escalated, as well as provide a comprehensive view to allow for scoping/convergence (see ""Time for some [CONVERGENCE]([convergence](<convergence.md>))

- On [convergence](<convergence.md>)

## [February 6th, 2021](<February 6th, 2021.md>)
- We may need a mechanism to find out **what to vote** and **how to vote** and make it visible to community members, which is one type of [activities](<activities.md>) we could try for [convergence](<convergence.md>).

- Integrates well with processes for [convergence](<convergence.md>)

- Part of the reason why I believe that [convergence](<convergence.md>)

- To better illustrate my point, let's look at a few examples of how the point of [convergence](<convergence.md>)
