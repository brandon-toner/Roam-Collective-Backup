    - [Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>) 
        - [Obs](<Obs.md>) Without constant sync support, or daily momentum in a graph, shared graphs can begin to feel like [ghost towns](<ghost towns.md>).
            - [Q](<Q.md>) What design elements could be implemented to move the focus from **daily** to weekly or monthly.
                - [I](<I.md>) Could the main page be the **weekly page**, increasing the "size of the net", and the probability of there being content active on the page.
                    - [Obs](<Obs.md>) The [daily notes page](<daily notes page.md>) feels too [fleeting](<fleeting.md>) at times. Stuff gets buried, lost, left unseen or forgotten.
                    - I like shifting the time-space of the fleeting element of the graph.
                    - Daily Page -> Weekly Page -> Monthly Page
                        - Simply changing how often the "home" resets! 
                        - If visiting and active daily, daily makes sense. 
                        - [G](<G.md>) Goal = optimize for user [collisions](<collisions.md>). 
                            - Times when users "bump into" each other, as if in a shared physical space (like a department, cafeteria, or hallway)

            - The "minimal" queries
                - The CSS that enables this is found [here](((KOuJf-Smr))). 
                    - If you inspect one of those queries, you'll notice the query in the block is prepended by `[minimal](<minimal.md>)` `[page-focus](<page-focus.md>)` or similar.
