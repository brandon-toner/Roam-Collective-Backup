- INTERNALLY, I think the learning center should stem off of the [Welcome 😃](<Welcome 😃.md>) page — though "Welcome" feels off, if it's a place for existing users to go as well... maybe we make a [Learning Center](<Learning Center.md>) that mirrors some of that structure, or at least serves as a directory for navigating the [conventions](<conventions.md>) in a logical order/sequence.

## [January 29th, 2021](<January 29th, 2021.md>)
- [ ] Create literature notes based on [this thread](((0PZ_hR4QF))). #[Week-05: 02-01-2021](<Week-05: 02-01-2021.md>)

- [x] Add the [choice algorithm](<choice algorithm.md>) template convention. #[Week-05: 02-01-2021](<Week-05: 02-01-2021.md>)

## [January 31st, 2021](<January 31st, 2021.md>)
- [x] Find out how to make this the default in the CSS (I know it's possible, maybe within the [Leyendecker](<Leyendecker.md>) code?) [cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]] #[Week-05: 02-01-2021](<Week-05: 02-01-2021.md>)
