- [x] Add the [choice algorithm](<choice algorithm.md>) template convention. #[Week-05: 02-01-2021](<Week-05: 02-01-2021.md>)

- [x] Find out how to make this the default in the CSS (I know it's possible, maybe within the [Leyendecker](<Leyendecker.md>) code?) [cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]] #[Week-05: 02-01-2021](<Week-05: 02-01-2021.md>)

- INTERNALLY, I think the learning center should stem off of the [Welcome](<Welcome.md>) page â€” though "Welcome" feels off, if it's a place for existing users to go as well... maybe we make a [Learning Center](<Learning Center.md>) that mirrors some of that structure, or at least serves as a directory for navigating the [conventions](<conventions.md>) in a logical order/sequence.
