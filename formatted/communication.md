- Our [communication](<communication.md>)

- in-time chat vs mail-based chat is one typical implementation on [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) [communication](<communication.md>).

- Our current [communication](<communication.md>)

- If I consider face-to-face chatting is truly [synchronous](<synchronous.md>), compared with other [communication](<communication.md>)

- #[P:Self](<P:Self.md>) normally, when we’re in the context of [communication](<communication.md>),

- When we’re talking face-to-face, we share much more states than pure words communication. AND, every shared state is the potential link to another topic, meaning that we have much more broader choices on topics, and therefore, much more possible for a [divergent](<divergent.md>) [communication](<communication.md>).

- [Q](<Q.md>) What types of [communication](<communication.md>)

## [January 28th, 2021](<January 28th, 2021.md>)
- According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [model](<model.md>) the [communication](<communication.md>)

- According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [model](<model.md>) the [communication](<communication.md>) **entity, as tags or block-ref-id** and the whole [communication](<communication.md>)

- **Property** of a [communication](<communication.md>)

- **Property** of a [communication](<communication.md>) entity is **reachability**, in other words, anything in [Roam](<Roam.md>) database that’s reachable, is a valid [communication](<communication.md>)

- semantics on [communication](<communication.md>)

- **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [communication](<communication.md>)

- **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [communication](<communication.md>) entity, in other words, each block in database is a [communication](<communication.md>)

- One handy starting point to build up [communication](<communication.md>)

- But [communication](<communication.md>)

- Using the [model](<model.md>) of distributed system([i.e.](<i.e..md>) each entity should have the ability to store, compute, communicate), beside [communication](<communication.md>),

- **[Related](<Related.md>):** Thanks for [your reply](((n_PNVqwuw))). I need to clarify my [custom css idea](((FehE8jv6_))) more here, my idea is that maybe everyone will have their own ‘best’ css setting, though some basic [alignment](<alignment.md>) would accelerate our [communication](<communication.md>)

- Maybe, we could view page as [truth](<truth.md>), in one [Roam](<Roam.md>) database, one [Roam](<Roam.md>) community, where these [truth](<truth.md>) are built on axioms and logical inference, and [communication](<communication.md>)

- [Viewing page as truth](((H6M1XTGet))) is a concrete [goals](<goals.md>) to make our [communication](<communication.md>)

- **[Example](<Example.md>):** I think the following chat reveals the short process how I [converge](<converge.md>) the [communication](<communication.md>).

- It introduce the idea **protocol**, which is itself a mature and basic concept in the computer network communication. We could dig out more ideas on [communication](<communication.md>)
