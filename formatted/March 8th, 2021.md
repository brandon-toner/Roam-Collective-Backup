            - Yup that's right! Change log is just for big changes that might affect other people.
        - [~[[Kaito Kikuchi](<~[[Kaito Kikuchi.md>)]] [welcome!](((HJB-DxxGd)))
            - Glad to have you here! Jump right in and let me know if you have any questions. 
            - Would also love your thoughts/impressions within a [Feedback](<Feedback.md>) section (simply add it in your section and nest thoughts underneath.)
                - I'm interested in the good, the interesting, the confusing, the unclear, the exciting, the intimidating, etc etc. [cc:[[Alysson M. Costa](<cc:[[Alysson M. Costa.md>)]]
        - [~[[Kaito Kikuchi](<~[[Kaito Kikuchi.md>)]] on [what does one even do here lol](((RKEbGdx60))) [*]([cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]])[*]([Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>))[*]([Feedback](<Feedback.md>))
            - Think of this as a public thinking space. 
            - A central focus is the development of effective collaboration conventions for groups or teams in Roam ‚Äî but it is much broader than that. 
            - You could legit talk about your anything (your fav foods, projects you're working on, an article that just blew your mind) and this is a place where people can engage with you on those ideas in a meaningful way.
            - Conversational energy oscillates, in that sometimes were are LIVELY with activity, and sometimes it fades ‚Äî but part of the aim is how to manage that ebb and flow and to figure out good async systems.
            - One thing has become VERY clear to mean.

                    - There is some [dopamine](<dopamine.md>) shit going on here for sure haha. 
                    - I use graphs like this more than [Twitter](<Twitter.md>) now.
                    - The depth of conversation, interactivity and the continuous build of ideas is incredible.
    - #[Change Log](<Change Log.md>) 
        - CSS Changes general approach = softened appearance: (with versions)
            - Notification Tags
            - Top Section
            - Block-Level Tags
            - DNP Modules
        - Changed [Roam42](<Roam42.md>) to test version
            - New "OPENPAGE"/"SIDEBAR" Commands available.
            - Can now auto-open conversation module in the sidebar on running the DNP (from there, pin it for the day) - [here's mine.](((tz8gJ1NJv)))
        - I murdered the FN tag üò±
            - Too much baggage with other systems of note-taking.
            - Now it's just the "N-note" ‚Äî at least for now. 
            - Same usage, different name.

        - Finally had some time to check this! Looks really interesting. Lots to learn! I created a page Alysson by mistake and deleted it. I don't believe this a is case for change log.

        - I'm starting to explore the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)s and find them very informative, especially seeing how people structure them
            - For example, [structuring Literature Notes as Verbatim Notes to combat cognitive burden](((kvrzNKc5u))) was revelatory for me.
        - I have a harder time grasping __how people use__ Roam Collective. 
            - Pointers to what do people do every day, what is a typical flow, example conversations and pages could be very informative for beginners getting up to speed.

            - OK this was really helpful! Thank you!
            - I like how a lot of thought is going into building good conventions for collaborative thinking
