- It's early days but I've worked up some `:q` [queries](<queries.md>) that will find people who have referenced blocks of yours that you have yet to see. I'll be creating some kind of notification center within roam first I think. Not sure yet how to tackle notifications when you're away from the roam graph. This may just be something we wait for the full [Roam API](<Roam API.md>)
