                    - Options
                        - Leader goes depth-first, mapping the scope, purpose, objectives, and tasks. Then everyone chips away at the work as it is defined.
                            - **[Pros](<Pros.md>):**
                                - Leader can "pave the way" and others can easily identify work to contribute to.

                                - The leader can become a bottleneck.
                                - Other options/opportunites could be missed.
                                - Risk of less buy-in engagement if people are less "part of the process"
                        - Everyone brainstorms to define the work, then the leader decides on the direction (using the overall mission, vision and values of the organization/community to guide the decision)
                            - **[Pros](<Pros.md>):**
                                - Everyone has an opportunity to contribute to the direction of work.
                                - More collective buy-in and commitment to the work and direction of development.
                                - Leader has more information available to make a good decision.

                                - Can be more chaotic and exploratory.

            - Right now our behaviour on bookmarks isnt block-level though... We nest multiple bookmarks under a single `[Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)` tag.
                - The beauty of this workflow is I can filter `Bookmarks` by `bnt` to see mine, by `csf` to see yours etc. And further filter by `Follow Up` to see that intersection.
                - I wouldn't consider Bookmarks a block-level tag.

            - The same thing could be done using the block-level tags. I often jump right into the fleeting notes if I have the clarity to do so on the topic, or **I'll write more until I do**... or ask more questions.
                - The goal is a self-directed conversation that you mediate and tag using the block level tags.
                - Capturing clarity of thought as it surfaces in whatever form it presents.
                - Still very bottom-up. The option to write-to-think without block-tags is still there and encouraged.

What's your take on fleeting notes that come from personal experience/journaling sessions?
                        - [Beau Haan](<Beau Haan.md>) I have a Project Zettelkasten, structured the same way, but without the Literature Notes (since I am the author) and the Reference Note links to the URL of the journaling ‚Äî But I have these Project notes completely fire-walled from the main Zettelkasten in order to keep my dialogue partner as formidable as possible. 
                            - But I actually prefer to use the journaling as a way to play with ideas and then when I stumble upon an article that resonates with me‚ÄîI take that and create new Permanent Notes in the main Zettelkasten, since then the information is useful over time, compounding

            - "What are your thoughts?"
                - Maybe not journaling but certainly a more reflective process, and less focused on blocks compared to RC
                    - With how you guys do it here, it's breaking down thinking block by block. Beau uses a "wall of text", multiple blocks, for one fleeting note, permanent note, etc.
                        - I guess the idea is that the divergence at the beginning, when you're writing a fleeting note, is less important for him to resurface, and he wants to focus attention on the parent block, where the big idea is summarized (calls them "thumbnails")
                        - He's training us, with the daily writing sessions, to write freely and extensively, and then abstract from that. Less focus on being clear and intentional about what you're writing from the start, it's a wild free ride, but then going back and abstracting
                            - bottom up
                            - Writing to think, then hiding that (although you can come back for context) and collapsing it under "thumbnails" of thought

        - On the value of [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>)
            - More and more, I am realizing that I use the `#` functionally in a fundamentally different way that standard `[[]]` page references. The biggest different is when I use a `#` I rarely plan on visiting the page. Instead, I am looking to surface the associated blocks through queries at some future time.
                - [FN](<FN.md>) A users planned method of [information retrieval](<information retrieval.md>) will impact all of the [knowledge](<knowledge.md>) [structure](<structure.md>)s they prefer using

                - Under this usage of the `#` convention, there are essentially two sub-conventions ‚Äî using the `#` as [section tags](<section tags.md>) and as [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>).
                    - I see section tags as being used best to aggregate **general** thoughts and information. They are scratchpads of one form or another. The information that is contained is either prose (like this) or unrefined ideas.
                        - [FN](<FN.md>) [Section-level tags]([section tags](<section tags.md>)) should be used to aggregate loosely held ideas and general thoughts.
                    - I see block-level tags as being used best to summarize **atomic** and **focused** thoughts (of varying types and maturities). The information at the level of the block level tag should be digestible on its own, with context nested underneath. The context can be terse or flowing, rough or developed, but the priority for the highest block should be **concise** as hell.
                        - [FN](<FN.md>) [Block-level tags]([block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>)) should be used to summarize atomic and focused thoughts and pieces of knowledge
                - One of the [implicit](<implicit.md>) differences between these [two tag types](((loZtX8kki))) ‚Äî [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) and [section tags](<section tags.md>) ‚Äî  is their [maturity](<maturity.md>).
                    - A thought that can be summarized in a single-block is at least somewhat thought out. One that requires an entire section may be chipping away at a unified idea, but the final understanding/idea is still [fluid]([fluidity](<fluidity.md>)).
            - Taking all of the above into account, we can use the implicit distinct between [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) and [section tags](<section tags.md>) to help [parse](((AcVV2n11w))) out [signal](<signal.md>) versus [noise](<noise.md>).
                - [FN](<FN.md>) [Block-level tags]([block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>)) tags can effectively increase the [signal-to-noise ratio](<signal-to-noise ratio.md>) by proactively parsing out [mature]([maturity](<maturity.md>)) thoughts.
            - Block-level tags tangentially related benefits as well...
                - They allow for the identification and summarization of high-quality thoughts anywhere in the graph.
                    - Often this leads to creation in-line with important contextual information.

                - If you want to be able to resurface Bookmarks, you need [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>); the `[Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)` section won't meet your needs
                - I use the `[Follow](<Follow.md>) Up` block in this way, but it's not perfect
            - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) I think that one of the biggest reasons why I like singular for [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) is that it distinguishes between an atomic block and a collection.
                - `[Bookmark](<Bookmark.md>)` is a block-level bookmark
                - `[Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)` is a collection of `[Bookmark](<Bookmark.md>)` blocks
                - Will be easier to implement once Roam has [aliases](<aliases.md>), but in the interim queries can fill the gap
                - Franky, I don't think the collection of Bookmarks is even necessary ‚Äî it's highly personal, so all you really care about are `[Bookmark](<Bookmark.md>)` blocks you've added to your personal note section ‚Äî very little need to see the sum-total of Bookmarks in the graph
            - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) re: [this is true](((jz6oBckoK))), but if Sam wanted to be able to surface bookmarks programmatically, they would need to be block-level tags!
