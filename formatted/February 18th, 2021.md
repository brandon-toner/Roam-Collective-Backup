                - Yeah I think there's a low hanging fruit there, just making a simple, clear, explanation.
                    - Maybe just drawing some of these things out (how ShareDB works, simple, but even simpler when illustrated)
            - [re ](((0oR0z3jPD))) Wow this is some really training, you basically broke down my idea. I have a bit of a hard time formalizing my thinking by writing actually, I'm used to do it a lot in my head. This is great!
                - I like the `[Ans](<Ans.md>)` tag
                - Will add more fleeting notes/answers/questions

                - Haven't got the details yet of how Sonke does it
            - "What are your thoughts?"
                - Maybe not journaling but certainly a more reflective process, and less focused on blocks compared to RC
                    - With how you guys do it here, it's breaking down thinking block by block. Beau uses a "wall of text", multiple blocks, for one fleeting note, permanent note, etc.
                        - I guess the idea is that the divergence at the beginning, when you're writing a fleeting note, is less important for him to resurface, and he wants to focus attention on the parent block, where the big idea is summarized (calls them "thumbnails")
                        - He's training us, with the daily writing sessions, to write freely and extensively, and then abstract from that. Less focus on being clear and intentional about what you're writing from the start, it's a wild free ride, but then going back and abstracting
                            - bottom up
                            - Writing to think, then hiding that (although you can come back for context) and collapsing it under "thumbnails" of thought

                    - See: "On moving towards a more agnostic [taxonomy](<taxonomy.md>)/[mythology](<mythology.md>) of notes..."
                        - Goal was to use simpler language that  spoke to the information a given note contained ‚Äî essentially it's just [Joel's]([cc:[[Joel Chan](<cc:[[Joel Chan.md>)]]) system with the addition of a `[FN](<FN.md>)` level that I call a `[Notion](<Notion.md>)`

                - If you want to be able to resurface Bookmarks, you need [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>); the `[Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)` section won't meet your needs
                - I use the `[Follow](<Follow.md>) Up` block in this way, but it's not perfect
            - [@Brandon]([@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) I think that one of the biggest reasons why I like singular for [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) is that it distinguishes between an atomic block and a collection.
                - `[Bookmark](<Bookmark.md>)` is a block-level bookmark
                - `[Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)` is a collection of `[Bookmark](<Bookmark.md>)` blocks
                - Will be easier to implement once Roam has [aliases](<aliases.md>), but in the interim queries can fill the gap
                - Franky, I don't think the collection of Bookmarks is even necessary ‚Äî it's highly personal, so all you really care about are `[Bookmark](<Bookmark.md>)` blocks you've added to your personal note section ‚Äî very little need to see the sum-total of Bookmarks in the graph
