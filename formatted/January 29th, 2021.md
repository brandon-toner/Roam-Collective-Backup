                - For personal naming conventions, I like `BToner` ([FLast])((reason: keeps the initials intact, so I can type BT)) or a personally designated SmartBlock user code. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it is: [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
                    - Easy to trigger.
                    - Unique (no conflict with another user ([i.e.](<i.e..md>) 2 "BT's" in the graph))
                    - Doesn't get confused with the global smartblock ("Community functions" [*](((DcXN7XPbc)))).

                        - Love [this](((pNHeT0VNp))) convention... I'm gonna adopt.
I'd also add a `.` before the `rcDNP` to `.rcDNP` to benefit in [sorting](<sorting.md>). (__In common ones__)

                    - Less of an [assertion]([assertions](<assertions.md>)), but it is a concept that I refer to periodically. 
                    - **I'm going to call it an EN**... because it's UTILITY feels similar/the same.

        - "Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention.

            - Yea, I think we'll go with nesting as standard convention for now. My strategy for navigating is to Shift-click to open the reference in the side bar, giving me easier access to the [breadcrumbs](<breadcrumbs.md>). [~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]] 
                - Definitely open to re-evaluating this over time.

        - "You may want to distinguish these two concepts a little bit deep first. And the distinctions themselves will become [assertions](<assertions.md>)."

            - Drawing some justification from this part of [Andy's Notes](<Andy's Notes.md>):
                - "I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around).

                - "maybe the verb `level up`, can be served as a trigger asking Roamans to vote for the decision?"
                    - Another option is using the [choice algorithm](<choice algorithm.md>)
        - "Yeah, they’re pretty good [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>) mechanism, but they seems to be too **public**, and I’m always afraid that my non-mature thoughts will affect others information feed, and this is also one of the reason I care about public vs private."
            - Most of my meanderings are non-mature thoughts. IMO, as long as ideas are traceable and in keeping with the important conventions, their degree of [certainty](<certainty.md>) or [maturity](<maturity.md>) is less important. 
                - They can always be qualified or contended with.

            - The [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>) convention is a great way to promote ideas in a time-protected way, without levelling them up to page status.
                - My [threshold](<threshold.md>) for documenting a [fleeting note]([fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>)) is far lower than my threshold for documenting an [evergreen note]([evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>))

        - Also [this one](((j50xmn4aN))).  cc [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
        - And [this idea](((iMm8lcvmd))) seems to be interesting. cc: [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
        - Is [this idea](((UDqsAeKJg))) already in your feature list? [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]]
        - "I decided to consider [this idea]([[[E:](<[[E:.md>) active vs passive resurfacing]]) an evergreen note. I think it makes sense, but it challenges my idea that "#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>) and [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) should be [assertions](<assertions.md>). [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)" 

Thoughts? - [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)"
            - You may want to distinguish these two concepts a little bit deep first. And the distinctions themselves will become [assertions](<assertions.md>).
                - **Effec**t: By breaking them into smaller distinctions, we may get a more clear sense on how you define these terms.
        - reply to "[~[[leekeifon](<~[[leekeifon.md>)]] You're playing with some fascinating ideas! Love it. "
            - "How does [global public feed](((cnygMuVlk))) compare to the [The Main Feed](<The Main Feed.md>)."
                - These two concepts should have almost the same meaning. Maybe the key point should be another concept that I mentioned when I talk about global public feed, that’s **Roam publish protocol**.
                    - The Roam publish protocol is good, for the following reasons...
                        - it can automate the **in time update property** of a feed through query mechanism, without needing Roamans jumping back and forth to publish their ideas.
                        - It introduce the idea **protocol**, which is itself a mature and basic concept in the computer network communication. We could dig out more ideas on [communication](<communication.md>) through this ‘window’.
                - Another small difference is that they use different words, sounds weird... But the key word here is **public**. I wanna highlight the idea of public and private as mentioned [here](((j50xmn4aN))).
                - So, in fact, I wanna level up the concept "#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Roam {X} protocol" to be a page in [Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>). 
                    - But as I mentioned [here](((67MsLIbX6))), page as a resource in database, they should be voted before really adding them into the database. So, I would like to discuss more with the whole community, before we deprecate this idea or level it up or just let it sitting there till it’s mature to become a page or being replaced with better language.
                    - maybe the verb `level up`, can be served as a trigger asking Roamans to vote for the decision?
            - "What do you see [official events](((yuqfEynX8))) as looking like? Synchronous calls like with [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>)?"
                - Both synchronous and async one is good. For now, I’m kind of lacking visions on how online events can be within [Roam](<Roam.md>). Some ideas maybe worth digging into.
                    - Emotion/story sharing event? maybe.
                    - web articles/twitter thread sharing, rather than a book, which has shorter feedback loop.
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):** Jamming about notes on [Andy Matuschak](<Andy Matuschak.md>)
                - I mean, could we fulfill our online social need purely in [Roam](<Roam.md>), through different events, instead of merely doing knowledge synthesis? #[I](<I.md>)
            - "In general, I think the [I](<I.md>) and [Vision](<Vision.md>) tags may be helpful to promote [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>) of these ideas through time. "
                - Yeah, they’re pretty good [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>) mechanism, but they seems to be too **public**, and I’m always afraid that my non-mature thoughts will affect others information feed, and this is also one of the reason I care about public vs private.
            - OK well, about the idea public vs private, I just come up with another idea, which is used in my own database, that’s adding a tag like `#.concept` for a block that’s not yet been level-up to a page, but it could help the Roaman to get a better search for their own words in auto-completion list. A rather balancing way to control the complexity of a database.
            - "How might a [reputation system](<reputation system.md>)[*](((AClEvNz7Q))) be facilitated in a collaborative graph? I plan to do this somewhat manually with [Roles](<Roles.md>), but I'm not sure the best approaches yet. "
                - [Roles](<Roles.md>) is important, but you know, when the community grows up, the new comer won’t be able to get their ‘specific’ role.
                    - But maybe, they can create their own role by creating new personal feed or new events.
                - Broadly speaking, the [reputation system](<reputation system.md>) would have some property like economic system, and maybe Mridula would have some brilliant thoughts on it, I guess.
                - One of my basic assumption is that, treat page as [truth](<truth.md>), and if the community’s goal is to seeking more [truth](<truth.md>), then those contributing more [truth](<truth.md>), should get more reputation. And logical chain along side the prove would gain reputation again. In other words, the more basic arguments and concept, the more importance and reputation it will gain.
                    - Of course, this metric may be too dull, we may need more roads to help Roamans to get their reputation. 
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):** Seems that reputation system in stackoverflow works well for a long time. They ask by paying reputation and answer to get reputation.
                - And this is [one main reason](((67MsLIbX6))) why I restrict myself adding new pages.
        - From a pure visual(css)’s perspective, is it a good idea to add another tag like `#.Fleeting Notes`, so that I could hide the the word content `Fleeting Notes`?  [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
        - I may tend reframe the definition of [felt [[truth](<felt [[truth.md>)]] and [objective [[truth](<objective [[truth.md>)]] in my own way by talking about properties they will preserve. [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
            - [felt [[truth](<felt [[truth.md>)]] is hypothesis.
                - agree with current setting: "#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>) and [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) should be [assertions](<assertions.md>). [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)"
            - [felt [[truth](<felt [[truth.md>)]] can be created by community members freely.
            - [felt [[truth](<felt [[truth.md>)]] will not be deleted, but it could be deprecated.
            - [objective [[truth](<objective [[truth.md>)]] may not be truth in real world.
            - [objective [[truth](<objective [[truth.md>)]] is a result from [axiomatic presuppositions](<axiomatic presuppositions.md>) and logical inference.
            - [axiomatic presuppositions](<axiomatic presuppositions.md>) is itself [objective [[truth](<objective [[truth.md>)]] within that database.
            - [axiomatic presuppositions](<axiomatic presuppositions.md>) can be achieved by consensus of the community.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** We (may) all agree that logical inference is the methodology on achieving [objective [[truth](<objective [[truth.md>)]], so we set it as [axiomatic presuppositions](<axiomatic presuppositions.md>).
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** conclusions based on [Experiments](<Experiments.md>) result can be candidates for us to achieve consensus.
        - Triggered by [this note](((3F1bAiJBO))), I suggest a set of tags that I learn from [Andy Matuschak](<Andy Matuschak.md>)’s [[[R:](<[[R:.md>) How to write good prompts]], which encodes some patterns on how we understand a concept. In other words, this set of tags should be able to serve as a "#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Roam {X} protocol" when communicating concept. [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]

        - "Definitely open to re-evaluating this over time. "
            - Another item to consider is that long discussions (with this convention) will indent very quickly, potentially leaving little to no room for readability as we move closer to the right margin. [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]. Again, organic development is probably best here, and remain flexible.
