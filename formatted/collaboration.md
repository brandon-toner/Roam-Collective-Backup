- **[Related](<Related.md>):** Thanks for [your reply](((n_PNVqwuw))). I need to clarify my [custom css idea](((FehE8jv6_))) more here, my idea is that maybe everyone will have their own ‘best’ css setting, though some basic [alignment](<alignment.md>) would accelerate our [communication](<communication.md>) efficiency. But the **actual point** I want to make is probably trying to distinguish the idea of #[N](<N.md>) public vs private  when doing [collaboration](<collaboration.md>).
