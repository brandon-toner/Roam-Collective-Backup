            - To modularize the CSS, the best way seems to be to decouple variables for general color and then for coloring specific objects. In practice, that looks like this.
                - CSS block with color variables ‚Üí see: "Red"
                - CSS block with variables for specific features ‚Üí see: "Tags"
            - Then, for the `color:` attribute for tags either uses the standard variable (e.g., `var(--bg-tag)`) or a specific color variable (e.g., `var(--cl-red-900)`).
            - Specifically for your question [here](((OyHWMqBxC))) Brandon, most tags would use the `var(--bg-tag)`, representing the standard __tag background__.
                - You could also create additional tag categories, such as for DNP tags (`var(--cl-dnp-tags)`).
            - To your question [here](((1uVLjCSgJ))) Brandon, I am sure there are some best practices related to coding. [¬∞]([@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]])
                - By creating and using [variables](<variables.md>), you limit the complexity and allow for easily updating the graph. For instance, all you need to do to change the shade of red is to change all of the `--cl-red-x00` variables, or to change all of the standard tags, edit the `--bg-tag` variable.

            - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) I like the idea of using `[FN](<FN.md>)`: "OR EVEN simplify down to `[FN](<FN.md>)` and `[LN](<LN.md>)` as block level tags... [*]([~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]])"
                - [FN](<FN.md>) [Block-level tags]([block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>)) should prioritize short words with no spaces so users are not required to rely on the [auto-populate](<auto-populate.md>)d menu
