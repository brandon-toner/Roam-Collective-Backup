- #[N](<N.md>) ["N"-notes](<"N"-notes.md>) capture [resonant]([resonance](<resonance.md>)) ideas, mapping the territory of thought. [Patterns]([patterns](<patterns.md>))

- Once the map is established, [patterns](<patterns.md>)

- #[Q](<Q.md>) It should be possible to differentiate [these structure](((fQ5H_Edl8))) by [datalog](<datalog.md>) query. But I would like a discussion on the semantics of these structures. In other words, **why we want to distinguish these two types of structure when we’re writing**? It has certain [patterns](<patterns.md>)

## [January 27th, 2021](<January 27th, 2021.md>)
- As both ["N"-notes](<"N"-notes.md>) and [literature notes](<literature notes.md>) accumulate, [patterns](<patterns.md>)

## [January 31st, 2021](<January 31st, 2021.md>)
- Saying that we are able to render the block based on its inner structure(manually or automatically), then we’re able to **get intention of author** at a glance(e.g. fleeting notes block). But the **first step** to achieve this, is that we might need to **find out some fundamental** [patterns](<patterns.md>)
