                    - A common occurrence may be that the TITLE of an evergreen note may be verbatim from another writer, but the elaborations or thoughts on that idea may be your own.

                            - For the purposes of avoiding [plagarism](<plagarism.md>) and generating accurate [references](<references.md>).
                - On [order](<order.md>) of notes within the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>):
                    - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [Sonke Ahrens](<Sonke Ahrens.md>) describes that the order of notes within a [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) matters as much as the content of the notes themselves.
                    - This is especially emphasized within [Beau Hann](<Beau Hann.md>)'s expression of [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>).
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) How can the order of notes within the zettelkasten be represented in this emerging system?

                - On note [maturity](<maturity.md>):
                    - In the future, as aspects of [epistemology](<epistemology.md>) are integrated into the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>), an attribute could be created that helps to filter notes by the method of arrival at the idea. 
                        - "Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?"
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) How does the [seedlings](<seedlings.md>) concept fit in here?
                        - Maybe the current expression of "[Evergreen](<Evergreen.md>) Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims" as a block (not a page), is better expressed as a seedling to improve [disambiguation](((QyZaIx66_))).
                            - Replace tree with seedling emoji, same effect.
                        - Maybe all fleeting notes are seedlings?
                        - [Q](<Q.md>) Whats the difference between a seedling and a fleeting note?
                - On epistemology:
                    - "In the future, as aspects of [epistemology](<epistemology.md>) are integrated into the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>), an attribute could be created that helps to filter notes by the method of arrival at the idea. "
                        - "Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?"
                - On "However, to efficiently transit it to others, it needs to be more than a page title — you have to flesh it out"
                    - While I agree, I think the "fleshing it out" occurs over time. More detail can be requested by other readers, prompting the original author to further elaborate. 
                    - Getting a note to page status does help with the use of the idea around the database, if it is a commonly referenced idea. [E/knowledge graphs should be populated opportunistically to optimize for flow state writing.](<E/knowledge graphs should be populated opportunistically to optimize for flow state writing..md>)

            - While making [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>), try to make them into full descriptive sentences so that they make more sense in isolation from their original context. I generally use the guidance of [E/Evergreen note titles are like APIs](<E/Evergreen note titles are like APIs.md>) to apply to fleeting notes. 
The difference is that FNs are a bit more "rough" or less timeless in their content. They may be redundant with other notes, or require some further thinking. That's ok, that's the purpose of the note class.

                - I can record GIFs pretty easily, so I might start tossing them into the mix more often. 
            - "Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?"

                    - Within your [DNP Section](<DNP Section.md>) is perfect. The conventions are still kinda emergent for this, but I like how you did it.

                - Some reasons for hesitation:
                    - E vs Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes all as active tags feels challenging for [disambiguation](<disambiguation.md>).

        - I understand your hesitation [here](((Z4Z2VoSX-))), visual cue is quite useful for new come Roaman, they could get what you mean at a glance, **iff.** these visual cue don’t get mess together ((like using more than two fleeting notes at the same time)) and [aliases](<aliases.md>) serve the job to hide these messy situation. Or in other words, our [visual cues](<visual cues.md>) are not able to mix/compose together within a block. [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
            - So, technically, is there a pure css way to change css appearance when the block is referenced? There should be a JS way to do so. #[Experiments](<Experiments.md>)
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** When the fleeting notes is referenced, the fleeting note content should be erased, and instead, the referenced one’s background color will become yellow to indicate that it’s a fleeting note in a little bit implicit way, rather than hide its nature purely in [aliases](<aliases.md>).

            - Saying that we are able to render the block based on its inner structure(manually or automatically), then we’re able to **get intention of author** at a glance(e.g. fleeting notes block). But the **first step** to achieve this, is that we might need to **find out some fundamental** [patterns](<patterns.md>) we tend to use in block ((AXYZ model from Joel Chan is one example)).

            - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Learning [collaboration](<collaboration.md>) requires separate clear shared [goals](<goals.md>), to enable the process of learning collaboration to serve as a meta-goal
                - Epistemic status:  strongly held belief, shaped by personal experience managing teams and project managing myself on Roam
                - It's hard to have learning to collaborate be the sole goal, as it's then difficult to measure and assess progress.  How do you think about whether one is collaborating enough?  How does one measure success in the collaboration?
                - It's possible that I'm overly anchored on the one Roam Game that's stated re: project management.  In my own experience incorporating Roam into project management, it took some experimentation by thoughtfully asking myself: is this current workflow enabling me to make progress across my multitude of projects?  It wasn't about the workflow in and of itself, but about how the workflow was a tool towards 
                - My working hypothesis is that given how unbounded and malleable Roam is, the ideal project management structure will likely depend greatly on the type of project (e.g., short vs. long, high collaboration vs. separable).  It will be a family of principles, rather than a universal one.  
            - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Building norms for collaboration in a distributed setting might require very structured initiation, that may feel antithetic to Roam
                - Epistemic status:  intuition that needs to be stress-tested
                - Perhaps I'm overly anchored by recency bias from having read Bret Victor's [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) yesterday and the harms of interactivity
                - Within Victor's definition, Roam is clearly a manipulation software and not an information software; but it has an incredible malleability that makes its a multi-purpose tool.  How best to work and shape the tool will depend on the objective.  
                - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Effective teaming requires clear norms and expectations
                    - Epistemic status:  business truism, true to my experience - but need to think about how a digital environment of loosely connected people may lead to a different definition of "effective", "clear", "norms" and "expectations"

        - ADDRESSED - Are smartblocks working?  Wasn't able to action it for my daily page
        - The "About Roam Collective" page feels hidden - I know it's in the sidebar, but I think it would be quite helpful to have it in the recommended path in the steps to getting started
            - I was struck that the help provided a lot of instructions but I had to go looking for what the mission and goals of the Roam Collective were.  
            - In my initial exploration, I stumbled upon the Projects page because I asked myself if there was one.  I would imagine Projects - defining them as a community and deciding which ones to join as an individual - are a foundational step towards building effective collaboration 
        - Given how unbounded Roam can be, could it be helpful to present the quick steps as a video?
        - WOW - so cool: when a reference appeared to the block I wrote above, a message also appeared noting there was an unread reference 
            - Wonder how this works, and how it might work for blocks with multiple authors (although not sure authorship is tracked as blocks are showing up as "anonymous")
                - Seems like all my unread references are showing up, regardless if its a thread I was reading.  Will see how this looks next time I log in
        - Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?

            - "Excellent documentation on this!! "
                - Added the recommended tags!!
            - **["I saw this and love the idea! I've used `Rationale](<"I saw this and love the idea! I've used `Rationale.md>):**` with similar purpose on occasion... maybe `Basis::`? I see it as an [E/optional, but beneficial](<E/optional, but beneficial.md>) step. "
                - On an optional basis, for those interested in it, I think it could be interesting to develop some shorthands that help indicate both level of confidence and level of evidence.  At least, I think there could be some interesting experimentation around building collective knowledge that build from individual knowledge basis
            - "I'd place this within a Daily Log module instead. "
                - Better to place it under one's daily notes or within the daily log up above?  
                    - Was looking for a polite way to "log off" :) not sure there is a convention for that 
                    - For the specific goal of knowing who is "online" and to facilitate in-roam conversations (such as the one we are having), it could suffice to have a tag to signal that (e.g., "live now" or some other convention).  Then it doesn't have to be up top on the daily note

        - In the graph, we need to disentangle our approach and conventions versus those we want to share with others in the form of [graph seed](<graph seed.md>)s
            - In reality, there are a lot of different use cases that require slightly different structures — offering only one version means that we will be missing out on supporting a large number of different communities and graphs

            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I like the AOT but disagree with the choice!
                - My stance remains that there are a ton of benefits to having an identifier in the actual page title

            - My preference is to limit it to a parent-level tag and then a block level tag
                - This would look like

                - Benefits
                    - Limits the cognitive burden associated with tagging correctly
                    - Easily extensible
                        - Add an additional tag to add queryable context

                                    - [Q](<Q.md>) How should questions be incorporated in the zettelkasten (e.g., with fleeting, literature, or evergreen notes)
                - Downsides
                    - Context is implicit, not explicit
            - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [tagging](<tagging.md>) [conventions](<conventions.md>) should lean on using tag combinations as opposed to compound tags
                - Tag combinations reduce the total number of tags required of the user to remember — easing cognitive burden is helpful during onboarding and can sustain participation
                    - Compound tags almost always have more detailed and specific definitions — not easy to pick up rapidly in a large graph
        - "E vs Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes all as active tags feels challenging for [disambiguation](<disambiguation.md>)."
            - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] makes complete sense — I think we can consolidate it down to be a bit more manageable
                - If I were to build an updated format, this is what it might look like...

        - "Thinking of making the switch... thoughts [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]?"
            - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I actually proposed this to Matt haha
                - But yeah I agree — any type of communication, either with reference to a block or not would easily be captured by the `[Converation](<Converation.md>)` block...

            - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I like this SmartBlock a lot
                - Question that immediately jumps to mind is...
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) What is the value of recreating lists of TODOs on the Daily Note versus pulling from some central repository?
                        - In my head, the central repository could be a set of "dashboards" that help to track both live and completed tasks...
                            - In this way, it's very similar to some of the more established project management tools (e.g., Asana, Trello)
                            - The big difference is being able to tie work in Roam directly to the task and the project...
    - #[Change Log](<Change Log.md>)
        - Added CSS to eliminate the `[Evergreen](<Evergreen.md>)` from block references, leaving only the icon
