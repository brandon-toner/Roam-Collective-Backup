        - Some of my [Roam](<Roam.md>) related work:
            - I'd love to fill these lines but for now I'm a user and a learner.
                - I'm a believer for I can see clearly where I'm coming from, where I'm at and where I want to go. We aren't doing the mundane here. We are reaching for the stars and they're within our reach because we have the will and the tools. We all feel this to some extent or we wouldn't proudly be the [roamcult](<roamcult.md>). I've been seeking this for years and my first quarter spent with Roam has proven that it is the right tool. I've come far. I'm at a precipice now. I can fall off or climb the rest of the mountain. All that is left is to continue to learn best practices and build a rock solid habit.
                - My work is in participation and in doing the work within Roam itself. 
                - I hope to contribute to the community one day
