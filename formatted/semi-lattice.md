- [Highlight](<Highlight.md>) **[page 1]** The tree of my title is not a green tree with leaves. It is the name of an abstract structure. I shall contrast it with another, more complex abstract structure called a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>).

- [Highlight](<Highlight.md>) **[page 1]** Both the [tree](<tree.md>) and the [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>)

- On building a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>)

- However, cities are much more complicated than trees â€” in reality, they are [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>)s

- [N](<N.md>) [Semi-lattices]([semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>))

- My initial thoughts on how we can use the idea of a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>)

- If I were to offer a tentative recommendation of how we could utilize the conceptual framework of a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>),

- Calling it for the evening, but looking forward to exploring the idea of a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>)
