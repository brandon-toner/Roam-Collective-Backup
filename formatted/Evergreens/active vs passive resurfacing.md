        - [active resurfacing](<../active resurfacing.md>) is a more [reliable](<../reliable.md>) method of resurfacing. It involves the use of time-anchored events resurface blocks.
            - Methods of active resurfacing:
                - Reminders
                - Use of time-based [rituals](<../rituals.md>) (scheduled reviews)
                - Tagging someone in it
        - [passive resurfacing](<../passive resurfacing.md>) relies on [serendipity](<../serendipity.md>) or [context](<../context.md>) to resurface blocks.
            - Methods of passive resurfacing:
                - Ensuring that [notes are densely linked]([Evergreens/Evergreen notes should be densely linked](<../Evergreens/Evergreen notes should be densely linked.md>)).
                - Use of flags to sort content by relevance.
                    - E.g. `[Bookmarks](<../Bookmarks.md>)`
                - Proper use of the [DNP Modules](<../DNP Modules.md>).
                    - Facilitates more effective querying.
                - Use of context-based [rituals](<../rituals.md>).
    - **[Next Steps](<../Next Steps.md>):**
        - Reorganize content (feels choppy)
        - Elaborate on the various methods of passive resurfacing
