        - Hacked solutions are usually out-of-sync with [native conventions]([Evergreens/Use the native convention as much as possible.](<../Evergreens/Use the native convention as much as possible..md>)), employing workarounds to accomplish an extension in [functionality](<../functionality.md>).
        - Benefits of hacked solutions:
            - Help to improve functionality (at least short term)
            - Can cast a compelling vision that may influence the development of the core product team. 
        - Risk of hacked solutions:
            - Instability.
            - Future updates may render the hack unusable.

## [February 4th, 2021](<February 4th, 2021.md>)
- [@[[Zsolt Viczián](<../@[[Zsolt Viczián.md>)]] has put together several smartblock templates that will run a datalog query and display it in a nice way. It's great work and an exceptionally good article but in my opinion actually pollutes the graph with `:hiccup` blocks. The better way would probably be to use [roam/render](<../roam/render.md>) custom components. [cc:[[Brandon Toner](<../cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] here's another rabbit hole of customization to fall down :P Right now the smartblock solution feels very much like a ["Hacked" solution]([Evergreens/"Hacked" solutions are likely to break over time.](<../Evergreens/"Hacked" solutions are likely to break over time..md>))
