        - [Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bR1HVvDUhMXDm5SJB4Tiw4xGbrm9AfXWgbc), but the computerized component’s value lies specifically in dynamically scheduling and selecting questions to be reviewed. In some sense, the efficacy of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) comes from its power to __program your attention__ ([Programmable attention](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zJrfPCbY7GcpV9asEc8NTVzXTAV4TvRFMuY6)). Think: “{cron} for your mind.”
        - Manually making decisions about which cards to review would be far too taxing on a per-card basis. The transaction cost is too high. When that work is mostly outsourced, you can make a coarser decision—to devote your attention to SRS practice for 10 minutes—and then let your attention be directed by the machine within that block.
        - Within a traditional flashcard-style system, you can use this observation to go far beyond memorization: see [Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to prompt application, synthesis, and creation](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zE8PK4UUAAWK6LEcmr8jja8JdxpUxcf1FUCX) and [Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to develop or change habits](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z249N76MhdBzDfrwMnqP6jEsTv6Z8u2kJrp8). [Spaced repetition prompt design is about designing tasks for your future self](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4TCpuykanZCZYtC5xCccfuiTMZQzdeRv5BuW).
        - But the core __concept__—automatically arranging and presenting tasks according to some expanding schedule—can be instantiated in many interfaces and domains. I call this notion [Spaced everything](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z59aJSjgqr4B1k1ofoE7ZBF2dv8MeJ1Drf4TQ).
