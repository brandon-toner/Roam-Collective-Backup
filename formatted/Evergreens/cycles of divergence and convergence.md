- [Q](<../Q.md>) Should phases of [divergence](<../divergence.md>) and [convergence](<../convergence.md>) be at the same time for all graph members? Or should the individual oscillate though those cycles independent of the group?[*]([Evergreens/cycles of divergence and convergence](<../Evergreens/cycles of divergence and convergence.md>))

## [January 30th, 2021](<January 30th, 2021.md>)
- Yup, this is definitely in my conceptual [roadmap](<../roadmap.md>). I see it as [Evergreens/cycles of divergence and convergence](<../Evergreens/cycles of divergence and convergence.md>).
