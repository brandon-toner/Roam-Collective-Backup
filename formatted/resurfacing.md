## [Evergreens/Make evergreen notes as you write.](<Evergreens/Make evergreen notes as you write..md>)
- ^^As insights crystallize, document them as evergreen notes.^^ This allows those ideas to [persist across time]([E/Evergreen notes persist across time](<E/Evergreen notes persist across time.md>)) due to their enhanced [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

## [February 1st, 2021](<February 1st, 2021.md>)
- The other benefit is being able to query based on the combination of `[E:](<E:.md>)` and some topic of interest — for instance `[resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)`

- [min-con](<min-con.md>) {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [E:](<E:.md>) [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)}

- [min-con](<min-con.md>) {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Evergreens](<Evergreens.md>) [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)}

## [February 2nd, 2021](<February 2nd, 2021.md>)
- I consider most content quite fleeting and try to keep the good stuff by linking and tagging to concepts or collections I know will be more likely to [resurface]([resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>))

- Within [passive resurfacing](<passive resurfacing.md>), there are strategies we can hone to improve the [probability](<probability.md>) of [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).

## [January 27th, 2021](<January 27th, 2021.md>)
- [tags](<tags.md>) may be added inline at the end of the note or nested underneath to aid in [connection](<connection.md>) and [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).

## [January 29th, 2021](<January 29th, 2021.md>)
This addresses the problem of “missing things”. If ideas are documented in zettelkasten conventions, then they are easier to rediscover through various [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- #[FN](<FN.md>) When ideas are documented in [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) [conventions](<conventions.md>), they persist through time. This improves [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).

- My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [passive](<passive.md>) or "[just-in-time](<just-in-time.md>)" [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- In general, I think the [I](<I.md>) and [Vision](<Vision.md>) tags may be helpful to promote [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- "Yeah, they’re pretty good [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- "According to the [definition](((o2aZIL3oU))) of [seedlings](<seedlings.md>) and the [context](((8zuNrwoHM))) on how it’s used from [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>), these seedling note should have higher priority to [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

## [January 31st, 2021](<January 31st, 2021.md>)
- Maybe consider [appending some relevant tags](should be appended with any relevant tags to the idea. ((to facilitate connections within the zettelkasten))) to the line as well to promote [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).
