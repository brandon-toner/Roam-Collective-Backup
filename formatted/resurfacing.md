- The other benefit is being able to query based on the combination of `[E:](<E:.md>)` and some topic of interest — for instance `[resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)`

- [min-con](<min-con.md>) {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [E:](<E:.md>) [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)}

- [min-con](<min-con.md>) {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>) [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)}

- [tags](<tags.md>) may be added inline at the end of the note or nested underneath to aid in [connection](<connection.md>) and [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).

This addresses the problem of “missing things”. If ideas are documented in zettelkasten conventions, then they are easier to rediscover through various [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) When ideas are documented in [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) [conventions](<conventions.md>), they persist through time. This improves [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).

- My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [passive](<passive.md>) or "[just-in-time](<just-in-time.md>)" [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- In general, I think the [Ideas](<Ideas.md>) and [Vision](<Vision.md>) tags may be helpful to promote [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- "Yeah, they’re pretty good [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- "According to the [definition](((o2aZIL3oU))) of [seedlings](<seedlings.md>) and the [context](((8zuNrwoHM))) on how it’s used from [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>), these seedling note should have higher priority to [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

- Maybe consider [appending some relevant tags](((wyoVYXVX9))) to the line as well to promote [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).

## [[E:](<[E:.md>) Make evergreen notes as you write.](<[E:](<E:.md>) Make evergreen notes as you write..md>)
- ^^As insights crystallize, document them as evergreen notes.^^ This allows those ideas to [persist across time]([E/Evergreen notes persist across time](<E/Evergreen notes persist across time.md>)) due to their enhanced [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)
