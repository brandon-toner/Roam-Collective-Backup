        - 09:52 — Loving [Kahlil Corazo](<Kahlil Corazo.md>)'s idea for his upcoming [rBook](<rBook.md>)! 
            - Such a great demonstration of the type of thing I'd love to see come out of these [Roam Games](<Roam Games.md>).
            - Driving creativity. Pushing for publishing something finishing and "complete". 
            - Interestingly enough, he posted his [table of contents](<table of contents.md>) for the project which is quite in line with [today's writing prompt](((kLMNagtp9))).
                - I'm not sure by looking at it whether Kahlil intends to write it for the __individual__ or the __team__. But either way his work should help to inform some options and best practices for [[[project management](<[[project management.md>) in Roam]].
        - [Tips](<Tips.md>)
            - If while writing in a section like the Scratchpad, and the content feels relevant to another section, you can use that section tag within context to make sure what you're writing is captured in that linked reference section. — [i.e.](<i.e..md>) if you ended up addressing a prompt in your Scratchpad, you could tag on a Promptstorming tag to ensure that it was captured there as well.
            - Be cautious of referencing a reference; the "[double reference](<double reference.md>)".
                - Most risky in the Daily Writing Prompt, you want to make sure that you are referencing the block where you WANT your commentary to be placed.
                - Rather than referencing the block that is SHOWCASING the [DWP](<DWP.md>)... reference the prompt itself. 
                - This can be done by 
                    - copying the block ref ID from the block where it is referenced
                    - following it back to it's original place and copying it from there
                    - referencing the reference and then "[replace with text](<replace with text.md>)"
            - You can filter any of the main [DNP Modules](<DNP Modules.md>) by your name! (or anyone else's) — This is SUPER powerful for being able to narrow down information. As data builds, [the ability to effectively filter]([filtering](<filtering.md>)) becomes both more important and more interesting.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** Akiff's Next Steps
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2F4BF8PfKzR9.png?alt=media&token=1c07dbe2-83f6-495f-99dd-0aa8dba3b2f0)
            - Play around with [collapsing](<collapsing.md>) to simplify your view of the [DNP](<DNP.md>). I often collapse my section, or the sections of others to give me a change in perspective.
                - I believe that collapse-status is user-specific. So you don't interfere with how others see the graph. (Is this correct? [Questions](<Questions.md>))
        - 10:00 — Another source of inspiration for [[[project management](<[[project management.md>) in Roam]] might be [Nat Eliason](<Nat Eliason.md>)'s course. I recall there was a section on project management, albeit quite simple. [*](((616RDJ9d2)))
        - 10:07 — **You can colour outside the lines.**
            - While the templates and conventions used in this graph are relatively structured — they are "encouraged but optional"
            - It's important to think about WHY the structure exists. Why conventions? Why conform to similar templates?
                - The shared page naming, tag-using, and nesting conventions all help to COMPILE data in a predictable way. We want our ideas to blend together. To collect in the same places if similar, so that we can observe patterns, and draw common elements. 
                - This helps to synthesize and create new content on the shoulders of the work of others. I see this as the key strength of collaboration within a shared graph! 
                - I related it to the concept of [idea sex](<idea sex.md>) from [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](<Anne-Laure Le Cunff.md>) of [Ness Labs](<Ness Labs.md>). [Link](https://nesslabs.com/inspiration-to-idea-sex)
            - But... That doesn't mean the conventions should be __suffocating__! 
            - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [It is ok to colour outside of the lines.](<It is ok to colour outside of the lines..md>)
                - Some conventions are more important than others. If you just:
                    - Plus, the [editors]([graph editors](<graph editors.md>)) can always sprinkle some tags and block references in there to foster some connections. 
                        - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [Start writing, and worry about optimizing structure later.](<Start writing, and worry about optimizing structure later..md>)
                    - Nest your thoughts underneath a DNP Section with your name and ramble on nested beneath a Scratchpad, that's still great!! Wayyyyy better than writing nothing for fear of "messing it up". 
        - [Questions](<Questions.md>) If I [filter](<filter.md>)-out some page links from a page ([e.g.](<e.g..md>) hiding "not-populated"), does that filter it out for everyone or just me?
        - #[Open Questions](<Open Questions.md>) How do I "elevate" content to the main stage for more visibility? ([e.g.](<e.g..md>) I'd like to make [this question](((jteC3b2n_)))) more visible upon visiting the DNP page, but don't want to tag anyone in it...
            - My goal would be to put blocks that I want input or commentary on in a commonly reviewed place (like Announcements) so that it increases the probability of being seen. 
            - Maybe another tag that gets pinned to the top? The `[Mainstage](<Mainstage.md>)` or "requests for input" maybe? 
            - Using `[Highlights](<Highlights.md>)` is a possibility! 
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):** "Added first project! [Projects/Publish a [[Roam Collaboration Guide](<Projects/Publish a [[Roam Collaboration Guide.md>)]] [Highlights](<Highlights.md>)"

On the way to becoming [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) perhaps. I consider making a page link a step in [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) maturity.

                    - literature notes
                        - I almost like this term — but it feels too limited to "literature" — read material. 
                        - "Content" notes or similar feels better?
                        - I currently use it out of common convention.

                    - could we build some JavaScript smart blocks to help visualize key nodes?
                        - where are the gatekeeper nodes?

            - [Q](<Q.md>) How does a community's nature ([e.g.](<e.g..md>), social, professional, interest-based, for-profit, non-profit, research-focused, operations-focused) and their objectives ([e.g.](<e.g..md>), maintain standards, combat disinformation, generate innovation) impact the structure of the knowledge graph best suited to support said community?
        - [Q](<Q.md>) What are the foundational elements of knowledge? [*](((RljJeMbuS)))
            - What is the core set of primitives that can be combined into any higher-order knowledge represenation?
            - [Comment](<Comment.md>) This question is really more of a #[Follow Up](<Follow Up.md>), as I have a feeling this is a question as old as time and many smarter than I have pondered the question...
        - [Q](<Q.md>) Roam makes the knowledge graph infinitely more accessible, putting what was previously stored in your brain or disparate notes into a unified location — however, a Roam graph can still be incredibly difficult to navigate. Are there specific "views" or UIs that can help the uninitiated explore a graph / understand a concept? [*](((J3RHoNJDa)))
            - Gets at the point [David Bieber](<David Bieber.md>) raised during "[Clubhouse](<Clubhouse.md>) "Working with Roam"", [i.e.](<i.e..md>), it is "Difficult to share his raw Roam Graph"
            - [Q](<Q.md>) Are there design principles associated with display of knowledge that we could leverage to build effective artifacts? [*](((nXHqG3MVb)))
        - [Q](<Q.md>) Does added transparency around ideas and their foundations and development strengthen a community? [*](((E7WnIh2V1)))
            - Does it improve the quality of the knowledge representation?
            - Does it impact community participation and relationships?
        - [Q](<Q.md>) Should a graph stipulate stylistic approaches to writing? If so, in what contexts? [*](((KKSDDfhmZ)))
            -  For example, in consulting there is a strong emphasis on using [The Pyramid Principle](<The Pyramid Principle.md>) pioneered by Barbara Minto at McKinsey
                - Funnily enough, writing using the principle resembles the trees in Roam
                - Goal was to write in a way that an argument that could easily be broken into its components. The components could then be reused. Also allowed for easier flattening.
                - Another important element was taking an [inductive](<inductive.md>) approach — essentially showing the answer up front and then digging into the details where necessary
                    - As opposed to a [deductive](<deductive.md>) approach, which slowly builds knowledge by stacking details until arriving at the final answer
                        - Most problems are solved deductively, but there are benefits to presenting a solution inductively
                - #[Follow Up](<Follow Up.md>) on the [The Pyramid Principle](<The Pyramid Principle.md>)
        - [Q](<Q.md>) How could a publishing layer on top of a Roam graph change how we share content directly from the graph? [*](((ZOKE8eFvq)))
    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>)
        - "I've landed on " [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)
            - Developing the question a bit more...
                - "[Q](<Q.md>) A [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) / [slipbox](<slipbox.md>) is a great knowledge repository for academic research but does it transition well to other functions?[*](((ulQPDnrKC)))"
                    - "[Q](<Q.md>) How does a community's nature ([e.g.](<e.g..md>), social, professional, interest-based, for-profit, non-profit, research-focused, operations-focused) and their objectives ([e.g.](<e.g..md>), maintain standards, combat disinformation, generate innovation) impact the structure of the knowledge graph best suited to support said community?"
    - #[Change Log](<Change Log.md>)
        - Added a second tag for questions — `[Q](<Q.md>)`
            - Goal is to use the `[Q](<Q.md>)` tag at the **block level**, which will enable graph users to query individual questions
            - Expands the function of both the `#[Open Questions](<Open Questions.md>)` and `[Questions](<Questions.md>)` tags
            - Envision being able to use it with [SmartBlocks](<SmartBlocks.md>) and [queries](<queries.md>)
        - Added new CSS from Maggie Delano to clean up queries
            - Here: "Query Display Options"
                - `[minimal](<minimal.md>)` — hides breadcrumbs and page reference
                - `[min-con](<min-con.md>)` — hides the breadcrumbs in a query
                - `[min-title](<min-title.md>)` — hides the page references
                - `[min-q](<min-q.md>)` — hides query header
                - `[page-focus](<page-focus.md>)` — focuses on pages
        - Added a `#[Follow Up](<Follow Up.md>)` tag to identify areas that I would like to return to...
            - See query aggregating these follow ups here
    - [Chat](<Chat.md>)
        - "Thoughts on this? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)"
            - 
            - One tricky approach I've used myself is to create a block like...
                - **Key Questions**
                    - <Insert Question Here>
                - Then in the ".rc1DNP — Daily Notes Template [42SmartBlock](<42SmartBlock.md>) [roam](<roam.md>)/templates" smartblock, add an `{{embed: ((yO46x9t2h))}}`
                - So long as you don't touch the top level bullet, you can move blocks in and out of it
                - Relies on people block referencing the block in question though, because you don't want them to write inside of the block necessarily...
                    - **this is a downfall**
            - Another approach could be to use a tag [e.g.](<e.g..md>), `[DailyMessage](<DailyMessage.md>)`, and a <%BLOCKMENTIONS:1,`DailyMessage`%>
                - This would require you to manually change the block associated with the daily message, as ideally you would only want one block associated with the tag at a given time
        - "Added a [Resources Template](((gix1P4auD))) cc: [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)"
            - Looks good! Similar to how you have the `For descriptions of the other "DNP Modules", visit this page → [DNP Modules](<DNP Modules.md>)`, could be worthwhile to include a  list of additional characteristics users can input...
                - Haven't thought about any to add right now but I think the included instructions is a really nice touch
        - "[~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>) — Added [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>) as a target artifact for this group. My thoughts is that if we can work to collaborate towards a finished product here, we can port the processes into [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>) and other communities. "
            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] 👌🏼— I think this is a great goal
                - Have been thinking in my head about having a "quiz" (using indentation and  block references) that would help a community identify which elements could be useful for their purposes...
                    - For instance... 
                        - What is your intent...
                            - To learn
                            - To build a new repository of knowledge
                            - To ...
                    - And based on the answer users might be advised on parts they can adapt or "seed" their own graphs with ([Kyle Stratis](<Kyle Stratis.md>) the team seed is fantastic by the way...)
        - "Thoughts on this? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>), [Everyone](<Everyone.md>): "Block ref the sections to add your ideas around mission, vision, purpose, goals, etc.""
            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] almost like a onboarding algorithm... Going to identify this as a #[Follow Up](<Follow Up.md>) because I want to think about it a bit more
                - One benefit of this approach is getting a bunch of fresh ideas right at the start of a member's participation, hopefully, without any of our current ideas biasing them towards what they think [multiplayer](<multiplayer.md>) Roam looks like...
        - "Thoughts? [~](<~.md>) [Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)"
            - It's working thus far! I like this as well as the unseen references feature
                - The `@` is great when your **explicitly** trying to get someone's attention, rather than just building on a block...
                - I will note that using the compound @ like `[@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]` gives you a bit more control when filtering
                    - Filtering for `@` & `Charles Farr` gives me all of the above blocks...
