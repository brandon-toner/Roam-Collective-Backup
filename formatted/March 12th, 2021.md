Shifted from using `#[Change Log](<Change Log.md>)` to `#[Graph Change Log](<Graph Change Log.md>)`, and to placing updates directly into the `[Community Notes](<Community Notes.md>)` section. (Like this)
            - **[Rationale](<Rationale.md>):**
                - Disambiguates between changes to other things, like projects. 
                - Centralizes updates across users without needing to review linked references.
                - Reinforces the [community notes](<community notes.md>) as a singular place to go for highlights on the graph (Announcements, Main Feed, and Graph Change Log)
