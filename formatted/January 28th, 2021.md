                - Steps
                    1. Anyone creates a project
                    2. They add it to the change log
                    3. They add their name as applicable
                        - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((A57j9482B))}}
                    4. They discuss the project with teammates, community members and leaders and necessary to gain momentum on the project.
                    5. They assign attributes as applicable
                        - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((YvnvKBKxB))}}
                    6. Ongoing commentary about the project can be nested under the project page within the [DNP Section](<DNP Section.md>)
                - [Handoffs]([handoffs](<handoffs.md>))
                    - Simply change the [project lead](((oGmvO4ycN)))
                        - This is a [query](<query.md>)-able attribute. `{{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Your Name](<Your Name.md>) [Project Lead](<Project Lead.md>)}}}`
                            - It might be even better to place the project status in the Tags line so that your could query for `{{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Status/Active](<Status/Active.md>) [Project Lead](<Project Lead.md>) [Your Name](<Your Name.md>)}}}`
                                - Project status would actually be **necessary** since you wouldn't want to see completed projects
                    - Other helpful queries
                        - "Projects I'm involved with" `{{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Status/Active](<Status/Active.md>) [Your Name](<Your Name.md>)}}}`
                - **[Notes](<Notes.md>):**
                    - This could also work well with [sprints](<sprints.md>)
                        - A project could be included on a sprint.
                    - What else needs to be included?
                        - Components of a project? Sub-projects?

                        - Milestones?

        - The concept “space” is hard to define in the context of Roam collaboration, as mentioned [here](((bIl7_WLyg))). But, the **correct public Roam collaboration space** should...
            - enable custom css setting, which maybe supported natively by Roam in the future. Currently, it’s just possible to use web-browser plugin.
                - The reason why this is important is that visual representation help lowering one’s processing work load on messy information input.
            - enable custom auto-completion list.
            - distinguish private feed and public feed.
                - Though there’s no ‘private’ in Roam database, but the idea of ‘private’ is just hiding the complexity from the public.
        - Some **concept** on Roam collaboration comes up these days...
            - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) Roam {X} protocol
                - **For example**, Roam publish protocol, Roam communicate protocol
                - **Explanation**: From the computer network’s perspective, all computers should obey some protocols before they can communicate. So, we need to set up a set of minimal 
            - Roam reputation system
                - This is the actual measurable reward for those members who’re producing knowledge and controlling their output complexity so that other people could find and understand his/her contents easily.
                - Soft rewards are better than restriction(?maybe) on encouraging Roamans to control the complexity of their contents when publishing.
        - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((yFC7BCyMf))}}
        - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((XT6pRAbyX))}}
        - One handy starting point to build up [communication](<communication.md>) [model](<model.md>) in [Roam](<Roam.md>) is to adapt features from different apps(e.g. slack, twitter, whatsapp, telegram). #[Experiments](<Experiments.md>)
        - But [communication](<communication.md>) [model](<model.md>) is not the whole point, it just serves as a component for better [collaboration](<collaboration.md>).
        - Using the [model](<model.md>) of distributed system(i.e. each entity should have the ability to store, compute, communicate), beside [communication](<communication.md>), we should also think of the [computation](<computation.md>) process. Logic inference is the important part.
    - #[Chat](<Chat.md>)
        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Is it valid to add tags to for ones usage(public oriented)?
            - For example, I may want to add a tag like `[experiment](<experiment.md>)` for the sake of easy query.
        - [~[[Matthew Vogel](<~[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] So interested in your [chat plugin](((jMzfRp8cF))) mentioned yesterday. Can I join the discussion or even the implementation? Some ideas below ...
            - One of my biggest wish to the chat plugin is to be able to model the communication process with both inner-selves(i.e. Antar, an Android app) and outside world.
                - **reason** why I wanna combine inner selves chat and outside world chat as one single model is that, ...
                    - we could model **‘I’ in different time as different person**, then, the question is then transformed into **async communication with outside world**.
                    - also, take the Android app, Antar, as an example, it mainly focus on **commutation between different modes of ones own**, e.g. angry me, calm me, etc.
                    - this model maybe [Related](<Related.md>) to [spaced repetition](<spaced repetition.md>).
            - According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [model](<model.md>) the [communication](<communication.md>) **entity, as tags or block-ref-id** and the whole [communication](<communication.md>) process as **publish-subscribe model**. More explanation below. cc: [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]]
                - **Property** of a [communication](<communication.md>) entity is **reachability**, in other words, anything in [Roam](<Roam.md>) database that’s reachable, is a valid [communication](<communication.md>) entity.
                - semantics on [communication](<communication.md>) entity
                    - A Roaman (e.g. [Matthew Vogel](<Matthew Vogel.md>))
                    - A group of Roamans(e.g. Roaman in [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>))
                    - A thread in [Roam](<Roam.md>) (more explanation below)
                        - the concept, **thread**, you could think of it as **a NPC in game**, it told you the information that has already been set up in the past (i.e. sentences leaved by others)
                            - In the extreme case(maybe someday), you may not even know who’s talking in the thread.
                    - An event(i.e. activity) in [Roam](<Roam.md>)
                    - A global public feed in [Roam](<Roam.md>)
                - **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [communication](<communication.md>) entity, in other words, each block in database is a [communication](<communication.md>) entity.
            - Maybe one important property of inner self chat is that, we tend to achieve **consensus** across different selves, otherwise we will get mad with our own. While communication with outside world doesn’t always require this property to be hold. reply [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] on [this](((XEO7RXlX2))). #[.concept/difference](<.concept/difference.md>)

        - "And what I wanted to say at the [Clubhouse](<Clubhouse.md>) meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [Roam](<Roam.md>) due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
            - My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [RoamLab](<RoamLab.md>). It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [~](<~.md>)[Kyle Stratis](<Kyle Stratis.md>)

            - The UI/UX for such things will get complicated quickly. So having a variety of global navigation blocks or similar might be useful here [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]. You could also see an example, though not really for this exactly, here [➡️](((lRBaD3yYL)))
        - "[~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]] I moved your comment on Beau's block to a nested position to promote better readability, FYI."
            - Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention. Honestly not that big of a deal frankly. Just an observation [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]

        - Connected briefly with [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) & [Akiff Premjee](<Akiff Premjee.md>) today on Clubhouse, discussed...
            - Orienting output in the graph around [sprints](<sprints.md>)
                - See: "Group [Sprints](<Sprints.md>) as a [convention]([Conventions](<Conventions.md>))"
                - I see the purpose of a sprint being orienting the group around a focus for a snapshot in time.
                    - The amount of thought emerging here is incredibly valuable, but it hard to accomplish tactical goals (such as building a [graph seed](<graph seed.md>) for project management) without concerted effort
                    - The sprint could have a series of associated tasks and members can pick them up appropriate
            - Building an [Urbit](<Urbit.md>) community for Roam Collective, with the potential to build an integration...
                - Urbit would allow for a persistent chat, with additional writing features
                - The nature of the Urbit platform could allow for some really interesting novel integrations...
                    - Writing the entirety of the day's chat (in urbit) into the Graph
                    - Displaying and linking to block references from the Urbit chat
                - The above are just two we discussed today, but there's a whole universe of integrations that could be built
            - Focusing our first sprint around the current [Roam Games](<Roam Games.md>) question: Project Management with Handoffs
                - Regardless if we submit anything, orienting the group around brainstorming on this question could be invaluable...
        - Looking at all of the [SmartBlocks](<SmartBlocks.md>) in the graph and I think we need to have an approach for delineating between personal SmartBlocks (and templates) and community ones [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
            - Types of functions
                - Community functions can be useful to ensure correct usage of conventions and to distribute information
                - Personal functions are great for testing out functions and for niche use cases
            - Proposed convention
                - Personal SmartBlocks / Templates
                    - <FirstName+LastInitial> + <Function Name> + <Experimental (optional)>
                        - `CharlesF + Custom Query (Experimental)`
                - Community SmartBlock
                    - <rc+Function Abbreviation> — <Function Name> + <Experimental (optional)> + <(RC)>
                        - `rcDNP — My Daily Notes (RC)`
            - Benefits
                - Easily distinguish between personal and community SmartBlocks / templates
                - Easily trigger the function in question...
                    - Searching by your name (e.g., `jjCharlesF`) easily pulls up a list of your functions
                    - Searching by "rc" pulls up a list of community functions, and you can easily specify using the abbreviations
                    - Note: These formats are helpful because you can't use spaces while searching using the `jj` trigger...
