- You can filter any of the main [DNP Modules](<DNP Modules.md>) by your name! (or anyone else's) — This is SUPER powerful for being able to narrow down information. As data builds, [the ability to effectively filter]([filtering](<filtering.md>)) becomes both more important and more interesting.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- Loving the (()) symbol for hiding instructions within templates.

- #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [conventions](<conventions.md>) (and likely many other things) can be documented in the same way as [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>). (sentence as page, with content elaboration and collection tag on the page itself.)
            - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- My [threshold](<threshold.md>) for documenting a [fleeting note]([fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>)) is far lower than my threshold for documenting an [evergreen note]([evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>))
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- [Viewing page as truth](((H6M1XTGet))) is a concrete [goals](<goals.md>) to make our [communication](<communication.md>) [converge](<converge.md>).
            - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- web articles/twitter thread sharing, rather than a book, which has shorter feedback loop.
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- Of course, this metric may be too dull, we may need more roads to help Roamans to get their reputation. 
                        - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- [axiomatic presuppositions](<axiomatic presuppositions.md>) can be achieved by consensus of the community.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- **[Example](<Example.md>):** We (may) all agree that logical inference is the methodology on achieving [objective [[truth](<objective [[truth.md>)]], so we set it as [axiomatic presuppositions](<axiomatic presuppositions.md>).

                            - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- Love this `[minimal](<minimal.md>)` [CSS](<CSS.md>) styling for queries. I needed this! Thanks, [cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]]
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- When referencing a fleeting note, we’d better assign a property along with it. Concretely speaking, that’s a way to indicate the relationship between blocks which would benefit us in the future. One idea that I’ve alway thought of is that we could automatically label inner reference link with such properties in a graph view, and we could do better sense on the [maturity](<maturity.md>) of the idea.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- **[Example](<Example.md>):** Just like this [set of tags](((dlHi_aDut))) when we’re clarifying a concept between each other’s.

## [January 31st, 2021](<January 31st, 2021.md>)
- Option A - `[E:](<E:.md>)`
                    - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

The difference is that FNs are a bit more "rough" or less timeless in their content. They may be redundant with other notes, or require some further thinking. That's ok, that's the purpose of the note class.
                - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- **Significance**: Based on this semantic, we could design block based CSS, which could convey structure in a visual way. 
            - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- **[Example](<Example.md>):** Actually, we could think of current `[Fleeting](<Fleeting.md>) Notes` and `[Evergreen](<Evergreen.md>)` a kind of "#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) block-level [model](<model.md>)".
            - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) block-embed [model](<model.md>)
            - **[Example](<Example.md>):**

- So, technically, is there a pure css way to change css appearance when the block is referenced? There should be a JS way to do so. #[Experiments](<Experiments.md>)
