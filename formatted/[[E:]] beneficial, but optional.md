- When designing conventions within a shared Roam graph, some conventions are essential while others are "optional, but beneficial"
- This type of convention is important, because the optionality reduces the [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) barrier to entry]] for new users and empowers a [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) low floor, high ceiling]] approach.
- Choosing not to use these sorts of conventions will not result in any meaningful disorder. Though as more users adopt and use them, it results in more [fruitful](<fruitful.md>) [linked references](<linked references.md>).
