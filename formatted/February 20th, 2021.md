                - I was flipping through a book this morning and the author would summarize their main assertions or "propositions" at the end of each chapter. Brilliant. 
                - The tone fits perfectly ‚Äî it is declarative, yet suggestive. Not overly confident in tone, simply proposing some facts, claims or assertions.
                - The term is unique in the current array of zettelkasten expressions ‚Äî as to conflict with RBCIII, etc.

                    - 
        - I've stopped using #[The Zettelkasten](<The Zettelkasten.md>) as a daily module ‚Äî instead, I capture zettelkasten ideas inline using the block-level tags within my scratchpad. 
            - [Obs](<Obs.md>) Ideas arise **in context** so having to jump section to put them somewhere else felt unnatural and not optimal for future re-discovery of ideas and context.
            - Instead, I've built a series of queries that auto-collect contents from elsewhere in my DNP section. 
                - [I](<I.md>) Something similar could be added to the [community notes](<community notes.md>) section at the top.
                    - This would auto-compile ALL of the block-level tags used throughout the day by all users ‚Äî and would be a great way to detect [signal](<signal.md>) in the graph.
                        - #[FN](<FN.md>) [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) are a great indicator of [signal](<signal.md>) within a [collaborative graph](<collaborative graph.md>).
                            - Blocks containing a block-level tag are more likely to be signal-dense.
        - [Q](<Q.md>) How do we adjust the color/appearance of queries in CSS?
            - The black/blue feels off with the rest of the colors/theme

                - "[Maggie]([Maggie Appleton](<Maggie Appleton.md>))"
                    - The internet is not finished and has been "built by a few privileged white men"

            - VERY hard to find.
            - This author came HIGHLY recommended to my by a mentor of mine ‚Äî who studied ethics and organizational leadership for his PhD and was a previous superintendent of a school board. I borrowed his copy of a different one of his books ‚Äî¬†and recently found a few copies online via a second hand resale site. Just arrived on delivery yesterday.
            - In particular, his book, [Books/Educational Leadership](<Books/Educational Leadership.md>) was recommended. I'm primarily reading that one now.

                - Yea ‚Äî¬†she'd love it. Great historical look on education, with a focus on philosophy and morality. It's a gem.

            - I agree ‚Äî "#[FN](<FN.md>) To keep ideas flowing, you need to keep [minimum requirements](<minimum requirements.md>) low. [momentum](<momentum.md>)"
            - [I](<I.md>) I think that "[flow state](<flow state.md>)" writing can take place in the form of TRUE "fleeting" notes ‚Äî ones WITHOUT a [block-level tag]([block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>)) associated.
                - THEN, as insights emerge in the form of questions, ideas, and propositions ‚Äî they can be captured using the block-level tags.
                    - In this way, the [conventions](<conventions.md>) both optimize for [flow state](<flow state.md>) writing, while being capable of [capturing](<capturing.md>) [convergent]([convergent](<convergent.md>)) insight as it precipitates.

            - Kinda both actually. Stating questions summarized and converges uncertainty into a manageable unit. 
            - They set the stage for future divergence, through further exploration, or for future convergence through distillation and summarization. 
            - Questions are special.
            - "is there any point in answering the previous question?" [*](((GofzUrNr3)))
                - Yes, and no. They are always there for the answering ‚Äî and the attempt to answer any defined question is always worthwhile ‚Äî yet, I don't think that questions __need__ to be answered. They can be left to simmer and set for a while, until they resurface or resolve naturally.

                - [FN](<FN.md>) [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) allow you to choose where to respond to others, at any step of their thought process.

                - [Q](<Q.md>) Could this formalization of communicating thought keep us stuck in ways of thinking that make us miss the point, make us slower, or keep us from more fluid conversation?
                    - [FN](<FN.md>) You have to learn the rules to break them. Being comfortable within some rules makes you aware of their limitations.

        - Code inspired dependency management
            - "[*]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) I was listening to a Python podcast before corona, and one of the episodes was about a graph analysis of different software packages. Python is a package which is still verified from the creator,  this gives the language centralised controlled systems. Other languages which followed more anarchic systems had problems growing and being maintained over time. Without an entity or a group of people, it is harder to how code would change over time. But at the same time, it would be great if we could leverage a more modular approach to everything developed so that people writing new code don't need to reinvent the wheel. "
                - The podcast explored the idea of centralisation of control versus lack of centralisation. Despite the latter approach ruby is still a widely used language, but what the Agora would do is to achieve centralisation. 
                - Every time I need to write new code I look for documentation. Documentation is accompanied by a centralised library of all the code that is freely available.
                - Another thoughts that comes to mind when thinking about code management and testing is CD/CI
                    - The idea is that code gets tested before being deployed. This works in an ideal world in which people actually write tests for their own code, but people never do that. When code is pushed to the main branch of their git remote, the code is tested and integrated into the general workflow. 
                    - If the code works and does not throw errors it becomes part of the bigger code.
                    - [@Charles]([~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) [@Brandon]([^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) ((see the whole thread)) One test case I thought that would be interesting is not to use the agora only as a way to collate ideas in terms of code, but do the other job of a dependency graph which is to propagate changes. #[Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies)](<Sprints/1 ‚Äî Roam Games 3 (managing dependencies).md>)

Some claims can be fleeting notes, but the converse is not necessarily true.

            - [@Brandon]([Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)) [On catching up on missing work](((us0FrcExU))). As mentioned to Charles [here](((nZRSNurhn))) perhaps an index of the topic discussed can be a good entry point? Maybe that index is already the `[Q](<Q.md>)` page. What's worth considering is that depending on timings, people might have a different level of urgency in catching up.
