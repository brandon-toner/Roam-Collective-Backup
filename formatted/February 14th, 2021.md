            - The problem is that that creates a big complex page. I prefer the dropdown for sure. 
                - It also mess with the personal queries, adding a result for every permutation of that complex page created.
                - The ease with the dropdown is using the [smartblock]([42SmartBlock](<42SmartBlock.md>) .rcNotify ‚Äî @Everyone Tag)!

            - haha, that's due to the italics in the new block ref CSS... I kinda like it too. Was an unintended consequence.

            - Also thinking on jumping back into [Hero of a Thousand Faces](<Hero of a Thousand Faces.md>) and [Sam Marfleet](<Sam Marfleet.md>)'s study guide soon. Lots of overlapping themes.

If the process brings them to answer a personal question or creating their first evergreen notes it would increase their sense of self esteem. ((Get those endorphins running am I right?)) [...]
            - What if we structured it in sessions. These sessions are todos in the DNP so that people can add things like the examples that you guys gave as todos in their personal section. 
            - Also, we could create a DNP called welcome? that has a welcome message and points people to the right resources in the right order. This feels redundant but thought I'd write it anyways. 
        - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) [On "recovering Twitter account"](((cNxFQnwKF))) Good luck it may take ages and they might want money for it. It's worth asking and hopes good people. Additionally, you can always change your Twitter handle. As long as people don't write it on paper or on websites we can start populating one with crazy content.
