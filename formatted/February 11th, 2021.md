        - **[Processes](<Processes.md>):** How to work on a sprint
            - Create a block within your DNP Section (Scratchpad is a great spot)
            - Include a link to the active sprint at the highest level that the work on the sprint exists. (i.e. nest your work below the sprint tag) 
                - **[(I decided against using the `Sprints` tag as a DNP module, as to not dilute the references for the actual sprints. Though, they could still be identified using the namespace, or by also filtering in `Tags](<(I decided against using the `Sprints` tag as a DNP module, as to not dilute the references for the actual sprints. Though, they could still be identified using the namespace, or by also filtering in `Tags.md>):**` so it's probably not a big deal...)
            - You can hide the sprint tag in an alias to keep things more streamlined and readable. (I do this a lot)
            - Use other complimentary tags beneath this block:
                - Tag questions with `[Q](<Q.md>)` , ideas with `[I](<I.md>)` related claims and assertions with `#[FN](<FN.md>)`, project ideas with `#[Project Ideas](<Project Ideas.md>)`, outlines with `[Outlines](<Outlines.md>)` etc
                    - This allows the references on the sprint page to be filtered by various types of content -- this aids in convergence dramatically. 
            - On the sprints page, contribute to the "Contribution Log" with a link to your work and a short description.
                - This provides a place for people to look for updates on the Sprint Progress.
                - Alternatively, you may look in the linked references for a summary of contributions 
                    - I suggest filtering OUT `Query` and IN `My Daily Notes`
                    - This would be a more complete data set, as members may forget to log work in the contributions log. 
            - I'd propose another `[Summary](<Summary.md>)` tag as well that could be used (and filtered for), as a way for a user to take a moment to document a summary of the progress for the group. 
        - #[Roam Enhancement Requests](<Roam Enhancement Requests.md>) The ability to filter out certain pages from the auto-complete dropdown based on the collection the page belongs to.

            - I don't think we need one quite yet, but once we start pivoting towards output, we could easily reassess the need for one. 
            - I'd say wait and monitor the need periodically. [*]([@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]])

            - Collections are plural in our convention, so I lean towards being consistent with that.

            - [*]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) I was listening to a Python podcast before corona, and one of the episodes was about a graph analysis of different software packages. Python is a package which is still verified from the creator,  this gives the language centralised controlled systems. Other languages which followed more anarchic systems had problems growing and being maintained over time. Without an entity or a group of people, it is harder to how code would change over time. But at the same time, it would be great if we could leverage a more modular approach to everything developed so that people writing new code don't need to reinvent the wheel.

                - Can Epics & Sprints be oriented around the same questions?

    - [Sprints](<Sprints.md>) [not-populated](<not-populated.md>)
    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>)
        - On structuring work around Epics, Sprints, & Questions
            - @ [Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) & [Peter]([@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]) ‚Äî yesterday I wrote about how we could implement the agile framework ([here](((6GfcqwQrI))))
                - As it relates to Brandon's [question](((_LcN8ZnW8))), the question should actually be outlined at the Epic level. By comparison, sprints are just timebound sets of tasks. An Epic can be one or multiple sprints.
                    - For epics, I propose a two part stucture:
                        - An Epic page: "`Epic/How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?`"
                        - Oriented around a question block and page:
                            - Initial block: "[Q](<Q.md>) How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?"
                            - Ultimate page: [Questions/How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?](<Questions/How do you manage dependency of ideas and influence within a community knowledge graph?.md>)
                    - How work splits across Epics & Questions...
                        - The epic page is used to outline sprints and individual story points / questions
                        - The question block is used within the outline of the epic
                        - The question page is created once someone takes the question on and is beginning to craft output
                            - At this point, you would bring a block into the page and use the "Replace With" > "Original" > "Swap Blocks Only" function to tie the page to all of the relevant references
                    - ` Sprint/` pages are simply used within outlines to Epics and to demarcate the work that needs to be done during a given timeframe ‚Äî [ex](((66Ur1ga1S)))
