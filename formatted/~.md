- "One thing that has been clear with all the multiplayer graphs I have worked with, is that zooming in on the bullet/area you are working on CAN be helpful to allow [Roam](<Roam.md>) to more efficiently sync changes AND it eases content moving right before your eyes. - since we will in effect be on different pages, instead of on one.

- You maybe right with your comment here: "Is this captured by this tip? [~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]] "Click on any bullet to "zoom in" for a more focused perspective (reducing the noise, and focusing on your section) - this also helps with stability if there are a lot of us writing simultaneously."" . Though I know that Zooming is under-the-hood different, from collapse. Basically collapsing is a change of state, not of page. Where if you zoom in, you are actually on another URL. [~](<~.md>)[

## [January 28th, 2021](<January 28th, 2021.md>)
- My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [RoamLab](<RoamLab.md>). It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [~](<~.md>)[
