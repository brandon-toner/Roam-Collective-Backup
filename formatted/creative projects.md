- Unless maybe a group of literature notes matured into a summary of the content... (but that feels more analogous to [creative projects](<creative projects.md>)

## [February 6th, 2021](<February 6th, 2021.md>)
- Rather, I suspect that key objective is synthesizing the learnings from our experiments within the graph and the research we bring in from the outside. In this context, the distinct between `fleeting`, `literature`, & `evergreen` notes becomes blurry. Layering on ideas such as [maturity](<maturity.md>), [curation](<curation.md>), [collections](<collections.md>), and [creative projects](<creative projects.md>)

- Maybe it's a "[creative project]([creative projects](<creative projects.md>))

- Use notes from each class ([N](<N.md>), [LN](<LN.md>), [EN](<EN.md>)) as a basis for larger [creative projects](<creative projects.md>).

- Seems like it's missing a step where [literature notes](<literature notes.md>) inform/strengthen ["N"-notes](<"N"-notes.md>) or would that happen at the [creative projects](<creative projects.md>)

- Both could ALSO contribute to [creative projects](<creative projects.md>).

1. Set [creative project]([creative projects](<creative projects.md>))

4. The [project lead](<project lead.md>) or graph [editor](<editor.md>) reviews the contributions in the [block references](<block references.md>) and uses them to develop their ideas and build out the full bodied [creative project]([creative projects](<creative projects.md>))
