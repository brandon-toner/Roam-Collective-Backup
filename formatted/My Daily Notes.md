- **[Tags](<Tags.md>):** [Collections](<Collections.md>) #[DNP Section](<DNP Section.md>)
- Using the `#[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>)` tag [Processes](<Processes.md>)
    - When writing on the daily page, type `#[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>)` followed by your page. 
    - Nest all of your notes under that block.
    - **Optional**: Use some of the other tags to further organize your thoughts. 
        - Using these other tags is not necessary, but helps to better compile information for filtering and querying. 
    - [Tips](<Tips.md>)
        - Use the [default template](((qONZuXh3Y))) or build your own to make populating your DNP section easier. 
        - Use `[not-populated](<not-populated.md>)` in your template to avoid creating [empty references](<empty references.md>)
    - **[Example](<Example.md>):**
        - This example is QUITE developed. You could simply nest your ideas underneath the `#[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>)` header — without organization under other tags. 

As you get comfortable with the available tags, I'd recommend using them to help with data navigation and compilation.
        - #[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) {{word-count}}
            - [Administration](<Administration.md>)

                    8. Added [roam/js](<roam/js.md>)
                    9. Added #[Q](<Q.md>)
                        - Questions that come up while answering a prompt. They don't stand alone so don't work well as open questions — but they are helpful to tag so that you can review the references on those tags. These are great opportunities for collaborative commentary. ((This feels kinda confusing — happy to elaborate on it if unclear.))
                    10. Added [Frequently Asked Questions](<Frequently Asked Questions.md>)
                    11. Added #[Everyone](<Everyone.md>) tag
                        - Similar to the @Channel feature in [Slack](<Slack.md>)...
                            - Can use `@[Everyone](<Everyone.md>)` to elevate something to everyone's attention. 
                                - [Q](<Q.md>) How could [notifications](<notifications.md>) be managed with this? @/~ wouldn't work bc when would you switch it?
                    12. Added [Welcome](<Welcome.md>) and the Getting Started sections 
                    13. Added [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>)

                    11. [ ] Improve [roam/css](<roam/css.md>) styling (make it more consistent and easy on the eyes)
                        - Background colour consistency... Dark grey vs light grey — what's the distinction?

                    15. [x] Consolidate and streamline some of the Getting Started, Start Here, etc stuff.
                    16. [x] Reflect on a [Resources](<Resources.md>) collection.
                    17. [x] Add some project-management and task-based SmartBlocks

                        - It is easy to tell what is going on. 
                        - It is easy to contribute.
                        - It is accessible to "intermediate users"

                        - Seeding graphs
                            - How can we effectively "seed" graphs with baseline information?
                                - Depending on features used, JSON or markdown exports should work relatively well for this.
                                    - When cross-graph linking comes, it could be as simple has hosting a source graph.
                - #[Roam Enhancement Requests](<Roam Enhancement Requests.md>)
                    - Ability to assign SOME users with global editing privileges
                        - Goal: Some can edit ANY block. Some can ONLY edit their own
                - [chat](<chat.md>) and [notifications](<notifications.md>) [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
                    - Originally, I liked this syntax: `[@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]` (from [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) II]]), but I kinda like this one `[@](<@.md>)`... 
                        - The latter gives you the ability to view ALL UNREADS across the graph. Plus, you can still filter `[@](<@.md>)` by your name to find YOUR unreads.

                1. #[N](<N.md>) [Block references]([block references](<block references.md>)) are key within a [collaborative graph]([collaborative graphs](<collaborative graphs.md>)). Non-intrusive commentary — the original context is preserved.
                2. #[N](<N.md>) Strong conventions within a [collaborative graph]([collaborative graphs](<collaborative graphs.md>)) help to maintain [order](<order.md>) and mitigate [chaos](<chaos.md>).
                3. #[N](<N.md>) The biggest hurdle is in ESTABLISHING shared conventions. Once they are set and understood, the system fades, and emphasis directs towards the content.
                4. #[Questions](<Questions.md>) How can we prevent a collaborative graph from feeling overwhelming?
                    - Maybe through strong onboarding? Clubhouse calls to address questions? Encouraging the use of the `[Questions](<Questions.md>)` to create dialogue about conventions.
                5. #[N](<N.md>) The Zettelkasten might be the best place for open questions... as they can be blended with assertions and other ideas. Less filing burden ("where does this go?").
                6. [I](<I.md>) — Might change `[Comments](<Comments.md>)` to `[Commentary](<Commentary.md>)`... feels more clear that it's commentary on stuff within the graph. [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
            - [Promptstorming](<Promptstorming.md>)
                1. From the [Prompts](<Prompts.md>) page: What types of products or outcomes could collaborative communities work towards? How might this look?
                    - For book club:
                        - Book reading companion
                            - Thinking of something like what [Sam Marfleet](<Sam Marfleet.md>) made for [Books/Hero of a Thousand Faces](<Books/Hero of a Thousand Faces.md>)...
                        - Study guide
                1. What goals or objectives would you like to work towards with [Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>)? [*](((ODwYwd-L7)))
                    - To create a [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>) that can be used to support multiplayer Roam communities.
                3. From the references on `[Open Questions](<Open Questions.md>)`: What is the best method of notifications?
                    - The `@` and `~` convention from [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) II]] seemed to work well.
                    - #[Q](<Q.md>) Is this only possible if "only edit your blocks" is disabled?
                4. How to tag ideas related to graph conventions and processes?
                    - Under `[[[Feedback](<[[Feedback.md>): [Suggestions](<Suggestions.md>)]]`?
                5. How important is it to stick to vanilla Roam?
            - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>)
                1. [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) any blocks you create we can't edit/delete — just something to keep in mind (see the duplicate comments and feedback sections below) — fixed
                1. [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) how do you feel about using templates? I like these daily note headings — I think using either templates or smartblocks could be great to standardize structure... Love templates, they help to facilitate structure — started some [here]([Graph/Templates](<Graph/Templates.md>))
                    - Feel free to add some! You could make a `[Templates](<Templates.md>)` section in your DNP section, and create some [SmartBlocks](<SmartBlocks.md>) there [Processes](<Processes.md>) [templates](<templates.md>)
                1. Added [roam/css](<roam/css.md>)
                    - I copy/pasted from another shared graph so I'm not sure what's there yet haha. Will sift through later.
                2. **Creating new pages.** All new pages should be ^^LOWERCASE^^, except:
                    - I know this sounds restrictive, but it is really important to compile ideas optimally. 
                    - Nothing will "break" if you don't follow this, but it will lead to a bunch of sorta-related page names and some missed connections.
                3. [Woah](<Woah.md>) the new "unread block references" feature is AWESOME!! 
                6. [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) Also, think that it could be valuable to build out a tag for relevant references or resources. Ideally these would be ones related to the goals of the graph...
                    - Yup this is a great idea. 
                    - Maybe `[Resources](<Resources.md>)`? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)
                        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] This would work. In my personal graph is use block level tags to identify resources and then aggregate them in a central location...
                            - Yup, this is exactly the workflow I have in mind! 
Community suggests via block-level tagging, then graph editors compile them centrally. 
                7. Just created my bio page at this point. Still reading through the extensive documentation 🤣
                    - I just thinned it out a bunch haha
            - [Chat](<Chat.md>)
                - Thoughts on this? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>), [Everyone](<Everyone.md>): Block ref the sections to add your ideas around mission, vision, purpose, goals, etc.
                    - Feels like a good way to converge ideas on something. 
                    - Note the use of the (()) symbol on [About Roam Collective](<About Roam Collective.md>)
                - [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>) — Added [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>) as a target artifact for this group. My thoughts is that if we can work to collaborate towards a finished product here, we can port the processes into [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>) and other communities. 
                    - My thoughts on process: [Processes](<Processes.md>)
                        - Use block references to the table of contents to gather ideas on the content of each section
                        - Editors help to compile the content within the references into the contents of each section
                        - Synchronous conversation (Clubhouse) and Slack can be used to iron out any points of contention.

- It's a small thing but could we could shift some of the tags and default template test to make them easier to select? Changing `[not-populated](<not-populated.md>)` to `[not_populated](<not_populated.md>)` makes it possible to select the text with a single double click in order to delete it when you're ready. [Same thing should extend to any of the 'dummy' text inside templates that's meant to be deleted.](#[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>)
