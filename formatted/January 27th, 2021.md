        - From `[@](<@.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)` to `[@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]` ([complex page names](<complex page names.md>)) — **note that the CSS box should wrap the name**
        - Can now "**save**" a notification by changing to a `^` "Mark the notification as "read" by changing `@` to `~`, or "save" the message by changing to a `^` "

        - [Questions](<Questions.md>)
            - How could we build a convention for "waiting for reply"? 
                - [i.e.](<i.e..md>) you tag someone in a chat and it is still unread.
                - May need a From:Brandon type page to include in a query
                    - [e.g.](<e.g..md>) `[From[[Brandon Toner](<From[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]` AND `[@](<@.md>)` 
                        - Don't love it yet, but it might be on the right track. Feels like a lot of work? Maybe not though. I'd rather the "from" information be implied by it's place in the graph... [i.e.](<i.e..md>) nested under your DNP section under Comments might work. 
            - How do we improve [Chat](<Chat.md>) conventions so that we avoid the "[shouting as you run by](((R9BCN_mmu)))" feeling? 
        - I'd like to come up with some topic tags...
            - Collaboration
            - Chat
            - Project Management
            - Multiplayer
            - ... There is a lot of overlap in terms. Having some set topic tags could help us to compile information by category - improving the ease of review.
            - I can even see this extending into other niche topics like:
                - Roam Medical
                - Writing
                - And other interest subjects...
            - The aim is that you could either FILTER IN or FILTER OUT topics to focus you experience with the graph.

                    - Actually... since this is [multiplayer](<multiplayer.md>) - there are MANY authors of [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>)! So I think make this an EN, with [David Perell](<David Perell.md>) as the author.
        - On the use of tags & [tag proliferation](<tag proliferation.md>)
            - I see tags as “optional but beneficial”

Nothing “breaks” if they are not used, but as more people use shared conventions, there are benefits in usability and convergence.

So, I’d say “if you know the convention, use it — if you don’t, rely on context” [Tips](<Tips.md>)

            - This "shouting while running by" description is great. I feel that.

                - Existing chat conventions work for now but can be difficult to find if you don't actively keep the graph open and continue to check mentions. I'm currently working on a plugin that would act as a JS bridge to other chat apps (a slack bot for example). The bridge would send you [notifications](<notifications.md>) of mentions and/or block ref of your created blocks.
                    - It's early days but I've worked up some `:q` [queries](<queries.md>) that will find people who have referenced blocks of yours that you have yet to see. I'll be creating some kind of notification center within roam first I think. Not sure yet how to tackle notifications when you're away from the roam graph.

        - partially in response to: "Explore the idea of chat in a multiplayer graph. Brainstorm ideas on how existing chat conventions might be improved. What does better look like?"
            - This is totally "low hanging fruit" that I feel has been missed, but I honestly I feel like a simple notification system when someone "reacts" to a block with an emoji, after they right click to get the "add reaction" menu, would be one of the simplest, easiest things the development team could do to help groups opf people communicate asynchronously in a graph
            - As it is, reactions are "siloed off" from the rest of the graph, which is absolutely too bad, because they are very content rich and potentially a source of valuable group attention convergence
            - basically, if someone adds a reaction, IMO, the author of that block should be notified somehow, or, non-intrusively, at least have a list of reactions that gets updated with "new/fresh/unseen" reactions, because I think that's a key way that conversations can start

        - With this huge surge of interest in solving the problems that us [Roam](<Roam.md>) users  are facing, I was having a chat with [Bill Petro](<Bill Petro.md>) on [Slack](<Slack.md>) and the fact that we still don't have a fully functioning place to chat, engage, and archive our ideas is still pretty glaring.
        - As an idea towards solving this problem, I really think if there was a push into figuring this out for #[Roam Games](<Roam Games.md>) would be very much possible.
            - My time at the moment is completely slammed with #[Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>) 3, so obviously can't focus on this, but I figured I'd stir the pot a'bit~
