            - The best way to achieve that is to keep live preview deactivated on hover, and to use `ctrl + hover` to trigger the preview ‚Äî works well for on-demand preview.
        2. Simple replies
            - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Damn, I should have [checked](((uQo0I4CWK))). Did you try to ask anyone at Roam?

        - Flowchart of information / weekly reviwes
            - Where should information aim to be stored at the end of each review cycle.
            - All conversations should either be archived,  forgotten or brought to a note level which allows people to get the gist of the conclusion drawn.
        - Can we formalize what we are learning about the collective?
            - I wonder what level of reporting we could do to turn this is a proper experiment. Publishable research is a good advertisement for rc. Is there any social scientist/ system-oriented researcher int the collective?

        - I love [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]]'s idea of [specific tags](((cfEfYDOAh))) `[Broadcast](<Broadcast.md>) / [Radio](<Radio.md>) / [Vote](<Vote.md>)` resurfacing using smart blocks. I wish [status flag](((hj8c8eDin))) could be set using drop down menu.

        - [~[[Matthew Vogel](<~[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] Can [live preview](((Ue69JZ6i5))) be used only on specific blocks/pages? e.g. only on evergreen notes?
            - [~[[Peter Rosso](<~[[Peter Rosso.md>)]] No, live preview is for all pages. I don't think there's currently a way to only preview evergreen notes. [*](((hZjna0IrM)))

        - [@[[leekeifon](<@[[leekeifon.md>)]] and that is [very clear definition](((1dcTvgxys))) that for some reason I missed - rereading your thoughts today, sorry!
        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] We can start [setting up the website](((m-bFHWp73))) either using a service like wordpress/squareplace or building one and hosting it on https://app.netlify.com/ for a start.
            - Ideally, it would be nice to be able to use specific pages in the graph as a way to publish blog posts on the website.

                - The idea would be to inject fresh perspective into the graph, before new users have been assimilated!

            - How do we inspire convergence in the Collective?
                - Activity: Pick a topic and just focus on curating around that topic
                    - Reflect on the topics and conversations that have taken place
                - Curation creates proximity, which naturally leads to convergence
                - Speculative outlining and curation of collections in parallel with more divergent activities allows for easier convergence
                - Collective convergence benefits from synchronous
