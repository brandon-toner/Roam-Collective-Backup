            - The best way to achieve that is to keep live preview deactivated on hover, and to use `ctrl + hover` to trigger the preview — works well for on-demand preview.

        - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] We can start [setting up the website](((m-bFHWp73))) either using a service like wordpress/squareplace or building one and hosting it on https://app.netlify.com/ for a start.
            - Ideally, it would be nice to be able to use specific pages in the graph as a way to publish blog posts on the website.

        - [@[[leekeifon](<@[[leekeifon.md>)]] [*](((rUTsMbOZ8))) I know some people do this with chrome plugins like RoamThemes and Stylish. I'm sure those could be ported over to roam/js but would probably be time consuming for minimal gain in my opinion.
