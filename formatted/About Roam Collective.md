- ## Roam Collective
    - This is a space to explore the budding potential of **working together** in Roam. And other things. Really, [this is a public workspace](((W9hbYSnOo))) — where we focus tend to focus pretty heavily on the meta-nature of this space.
    - We see a future where groups can effortlessly __accumulate shared knowledge__ and __accomplish shared objectives__ through the driving force of communication.
    - Conversation is RICH with value. Questions are asked, resources are shared, opportunities are identified, and ideas are born. 
    - Using this space in early 2021, we have defined and collected some powerful conventions that empower us to mine the value encoded within natural conversation and exchanges. But we are just getting started...
    - Our objectives:
        - To define and demonstrate how to collaborate in Roam.[*](((-VfLPtkvE))) [*](To define and demonstrate how to collaborate in Roam.[*](((-VfLPtkvE))))
        - To build the conventions necessary to enable effective knowledge collaboration at scale. [*](To build the [conventions](<conventions.md>) necessary to enable effective knowledge collaboration at scale.)
        - To help others learn how to use Roam effectively by demonstrating the fundamentals.  [*](To help others learn how to use Roam effectively by demonstrating [the fundamentals]([Roam Fundamentals](<Roam Fundamentals.md>)). )
        - To support other collaborative projects, such as Roam Book Club. [*](To support other collaborative projects, such as [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>).)
    - We operate with an agile spirit of experimentation and iteration — this is a place of chaos (**so put on your hard hat and buckle up**).
