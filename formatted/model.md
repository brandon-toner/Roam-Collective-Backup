- One handy starting point to build up [communication](<communication.md>) [model](<model.md>)

- But [communication](<communication.md>) [model](<model.md>)

- Using the [model](<model.md>)

- According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [model](<model.md>)

- Add [model](<model.md>)

## [January 29th, 2021](<January 29th, 2021.md>)

- **[Example](<Example.md>):** Actually, we could think of current `[Fleeting](<Fleeting.md>) Notes` and `[Evergreen](<Evergreen.md>)` a kind of "#[FN](<FN.md>) block-level [model](<model.md>)"

""#[FN](<FN.md>) block-embed [model](<model.md>)"

""#[FN](<FN.md>) block-embed [model](<model.md>)" conveys information in a rather ‘networked way’ while "#[FN](<FN.md>) block-level [model](<model.md>)"

- **Origin**: This is a concept I come up when I try to generalize the AXYZ [model](<model.md>)
