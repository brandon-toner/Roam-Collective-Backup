- Much of the day-to-day thinking involved in creative work is simply lost, like sand castles in the tide. Ephemerality can actually be useful in low-fidelity thought, but it’s simply an accidental property in many cases. We should do our serious thinking in the form of [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) so that the thinking accumulates.
- [Leaps of insight emerge from prior thought](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSn7SX7yMtnh1ZCQEG44TJoxrH7Udpm9oeEm). So where does that thought happen? It could happen in your head, or in a series of fleeting sketches in the pages of your notebook, but [Knowledge work should accrete](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6UDDkom8Aifg6mLdjT1sPtbMBweCmpyTwmJT), and those mechanisms are awfully lossy.
- Consider some hypothetical leap of insight you’d like to be able to make. To make that leap, you’ll typically need to evolve many independent, partially-formed ideas simultaneously, until they suddenly converge in a flash of inspiration. If you need to iterate on more than a few pieces at once, you may struggle to keep them all in your head.
- By contrast, because [Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1), they’re small enough in scope that you can start and finish one note in well under half an hour (see [Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6C5H4eYH2A4omfNLuUcDiKibQ1hZG2RGNZ97)). Yet each note you write represents an increment in your thinking about that specific idea, and each note enriches the broader network of links ([Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC)). Because these are [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), you now have a clear place to stand as you iterate on this specific idea.
- The notes you write will interact with materials you read ([Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6M8kex6kDF2FT6MWqAMDQddsqUr8sphLmyy1)) and will produce the foundations of new manuscripts ([Executable strategy for writing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3PBVkZ2SvsAgFXkjHsycBeyS6Cw1QXf7kcD8)).
- And if you can’t write even one atomic note on the idea you have, [Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to incrementally develop inklings](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7iCjRziX6V6unNWL81yc2dJicpRw2Cpp9MfQ).
