                        - Depending on features used, JSON or markdown exports should work relatively well for this.
                            - When cross-graph linking comes, it could be as simple has hosting a source graph.
        - #[Roam Enhancement Requests](<Roam Enhancement Requests.md>)

        - [chat](<chat.md>) and [notifications](<notifications.md>) [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
            - Originally, I liked this syntax: `[@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]` (from [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) II]]), but I kinda like this one `[@](<@.md>)`... 
                - The latter gives you the ability to view ALL UNREADS across the graph. Plus, you can still filter `[@](<@.md>)` by your name to find YOUR unreads.

        1. #[N](<N.md>) [Block references]([block references](<block references.md>)) are key within a [collaborative graph]([collaborative graphs](<collaborative graphs.md>)). Non-intrusive commentary — the original context is preserved.
        2. #[N](<N.md>) Strong conventions within a [collaborative graph]([collaborative graphs](<collaborative graphs.md>)) help to maintain [order](<order.md>) and mitigate [chaos](<chaos.md>).
        3. #[N](<N.md>) The biggest hurdle is in ESTABLISHING shared conventions. Once they are set and understood, the system fades, and emphasis directs towards the content.
        4. #[Questions](<Questions.md>) How can we prevent a collaborative graph from feeling overwhelming?
            - Maybe through strong onboarding? Clubhouse calls to address questions? Encouraging the use of the `[Questions](<Questions.md>)` to create dialogue about conventions.
        5. #[N](<N.md>) The Zettelkasten might be the best place for open questions... as they can be blended with assertions and other ideas. Less filing burden ("where does this go?").
        6. [I](<I.md>) — Might change `[Comments](<Comments.md>)` to `[Commentary](<Commentary.md>)`... feels more clear that it's commentary on stuff within the graph. [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
    - [Promptstorming](<Promptstorming.md>)
        1. From the [Prompts](<Prompts.md>) page: What types of products or outcomes could collaborative communities work towards? How might this look?
            - For book club:
                - Book reading companion
                    - Thinking of something like what [Sam Marfleet](<Sam Marfleet.md>) made for [Books/Hero of a Thousand Faces](<Books/Hero of a Thousand Faces.md>)...

            - To create a [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>) that can be used to support multiplayer Roam communities.
        3. From the references on `[Open Questions](<Open Questions.md>)`: What is the best method of notifications?
            - The `@` and `~` convention from [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) II]] seemed to work well.

    - #[Conversation & Comments](<Conversation & Comments.md>)
        1. [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) any blocks you create we can't edit/delete — just something to keep in mind (see the duplicate comments and feedback sections below) — fixed
        1. [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) how do you feel about using templates? I like these daily note headings — I think using either templates or smartblocks could be great to standardize structure... Love templates, they help to facilitate structure — started some [here]([Graph/Templates](<Graph/Templates.md>))
            - Feel free to add some! You could make a `[Templates](<Templates.md>)` section in your DNP section, and create some [SmartBlocks](<SmartBlocks.md>) there [Processes](<Processes.md>) [templates](<templates.md>)
        1. Added [roam/css](<roam/css.md>)
            - I copy/pasted from another shared graph so I'm not sure what's there yet haha. Will sift through later.
        2. **Creating new pages.** All new pages should be ^^LOWERCASE^^, except:
            - I know this sounds restrictive, but it is really important to compile ideas optimally. 
            - Nothing will "break" if you don't follow this, but it will lead to a bunch of sorta-related page names and some missed connections.
        3. [Woah](<Woah.md>) the new "unread block references" feature is AWESOME!! 
        6. [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) Also, think that it could be valuable to build out a tag for relevant references or resources. Ideally these would be ones related to the goals of the graph...
            - Yup this is a great idea. 
            - Maybe `[Resources](<Resources.md>)`? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)
                - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] This would work. In my personal graph is use block level tags to identify resources and then aggregate them in a central location...
                    - Yup, this is exactly the workflow I have in mind! 
Community suggests via block-level tagging, then graph editors compile them centrally. 
        7. Just created my bio page at this point. Still reading through the extensive documentation 🤣
            - I just thinned it out a bunch haha
    - [Chat](<Chat.md>)
        - Thoughts on this? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>), [Everyone](<Everyone.md>): Block ref the sections to add your ideas around mission, vision, purpose, goals, etc.
            - Feels like a good way to converge ideas on something. 
            - Note the use of the (()) symbol on [About Roam Collective](<About Roam Collective.md>)
        - [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>) — Added [Roam Collaboration Guide](<Roam Collaboration Guide.md>) as a target artifact for this group. My thoughts is that if we can work to collaborate towards a finished product here, we can port the processes into [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>) and other communities. 
            - My thoughts on process: [Processes](<Processes.md>)
                - Use block references to the table of contents to gather ideas on the content of each section
                - Editors help to compile the content within the references into the contents of each section
                - Synchronous conversation (Clubhouse) and Slack can be used to iron out any points of contention.

            - How does a group determine its shared goals for knowledge work? How do these goals impact the artifact?
            - How does the nature of the work impact the artifact requirements?
    - #[The Zettelkasten](<The Zettelkasten.md>)
        - #[N](<N.md>) The biggest hurdle is in ESTABLISHING shared conventions. Once they are set and understood, the system fades, and emphasis directs towards the content.
            - #[N](<N.md>) Shared conventions are part of the graph "platform" that enables higher-level tasks — building a flexible and lightweight platform allows for innovation and ideally lowers friction for users
    - #[Conversation & Comments](<Conversation & Comments.md>)
        - How important is it to stick to vanilla Roam?
            - It's my belief that there are too many valuable extensions to not leverage them if they can provide some benefit.
            - However, any extension represents a tradeoff in user-friendliness. Worthwhile to considering adding documentation to support onboarding. 
    - [Feedback](<Feedback.md>)
        - [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) how do you feel about using templates? I like these daily note headings — I think using either templates or smartblocks could be great to standardize structure...
        - [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) Also, think that it could be valuable to build out a tag for relevant references or resources. Ideally these would be ones related to the goals of the graph...
        - [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) any blocks you create we can't edit/delete — just something to keep in mind (see the duplicate comments and feedback sections below)
        - Maybe `[Resources](<Resources.md>)`? [~](<~.md>)[Charles Farr](<Charles Farr.md>)
            - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] This would work. In my personal graph is use block level tags to identify resources and then aggregate them in a central location...
                - For instance `[Ref](<Ref.md>), [Book](<Book.md>), [Article](<Article.md>)` which would be captured in a query within `[Resources](<Resources.md>)`
                    - An example would be `[Book](<Book.md>) How To Take Smart Notes`
                - A big question is just when to make something a page versus a block? Page architecture depends on preferences for namespaces versus using nested page references — [e.g.](<e.g..md>), `Book/How To Take Smart Notes` vs. `How To Take Smart Notes [Book]`
- #[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>) [Wiel Zouantcha](<Wiel Zouantcha.md>) {{word-count}}
    - How to get the most value out of CH conversations
        - Take it seriously, almost like a committee meeting
        - 1 person taking notes
            -  Or, one group talking, and another group taking notes
                - 6 people talking 
                - 6 people writing notes
- #[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>) [Mark Robertson](<Mark Robertson.md>) {{word-count}}
    - Just created my bio page at this point. Still reading through the extensive documentation 🤣
- #[My Daily Notes](<My Daily Notes.md>)[Akiff Premjee](<Akiff Premjee.md>) {{word-count}}
    - [Administration](<Administration.md>)
        - #[GTD Zone](<GTD Zone.md>)
            - [ ] Update my personal page with a bio 
    - [Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>)
        - The role of the moderator becomes very key in these settings but once everyone agrees upon [conventions](<conventions.md>) and more importantly adopts them, I think that will sort itself out
        - Created my own page and reading through the documentation to figure out how commenting and feedback works
        - This is actually my first multiplayer graph because I wasn't a part of the book club and so this is all very exciting
        - I __loved__ the onboarding and thought it was a great way to get started and get everything set up
        - Original thoughts are that I like that there is enough structure but also enough flexibility to create your own structure ([i.e.](<i.e..md>) specific [DNP Modules](<DNP Modules.md>) but you can customize your DNP Template to your liking)
        - The one thing that will be important to master is [conventions](<conventions.md>) because I use Roam in a specific way in my personal graph but there needs to be more structure and order in this kind of space so that there isn't a ton of noise
