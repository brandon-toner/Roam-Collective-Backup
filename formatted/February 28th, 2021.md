        - [Q](<Q.md>) How do you manage the problem of community fragmentation?
            - i.e. as similar communities with similar missions form, how do you allocate your attention?
                - The potential future issue that I see is one of re-work. And spreading ideas too-thin.
                    - The collective model somewhat relies on a minimum threshold of engagement that increases as the diversity of topics widens. 
                        - More diverse range of questions and topics = more engagement and members required for meaningful convergence on related topics.
        - #[FN](<FN.md>) [maxims](<maxims.md>) are practical and easily communicated distillations of knowledge.
            - They serve to summarize and crystallize a piece of wisdom.
            - [I](<I.md>) Collecting [maxims](<maxims.md>) central to a domain might be helpful for mapping the territory of knowledge.
            - [Q](<Q.md>) Are [mental models](<mental models.md>) maxims?
                - I think many could be considered maxims. The format is similar. 
                - I like the term "maxim" better. It feels less trendy, carrying less baggage from modern use and discussion.
                - While many mental models might be considered maxims, going the other way feels kinda awkward...
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) Is "a watched pot never boils" a mental model?
                        - Feels less so. 
                        - Maxims feel more proverbial than mental models.
                            - [I](<I.md>) Maxims may encompass both mental models and proverbs. 
                                - "[maxims](<maxims.md>) feels less religiously charged than [proverbs](<proverbs.md>) "

                - [Q](<Q.md>) Is an evergreen note a maxim?

                        - Are all maxims evergreen notes?
                            - And if so, 
                                - [Q](<Q.md>) Should [maxims](<maxims.md>) bear the `Evergreens/` namespace?
                                    - "#[FN](<FN.md>) use [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way."

            - [Q](<Q.md>) What are the differences between [maxims](<maxims.md>) and [principles](<principles.md>)?
                - I would wager: 
                    - All principles are maxims, but not all maxims are principles.
                    - Maxims can be more proverbial than principles.
                - [Q](<Q.md>) What is a principle?
            - Hierarchy:
                - Maxims (practical application of knowledge)
                - Claims (assertion of knowledge)
                - References (sources of claims and maxims)
                - Evidence (support for claims)
            - Process:
                - Collect maxims
                - Collect claims that establish/rationalize their value
                - Collect evidence that supports the claims
                - Collect resources related to the maxims or claims 
        - [I](<I.md>) [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) may be subdivided into [concepts](<concepts.md>), [claims](<claims.md>), and [maxims](<maxims.md>).
            - [concepts](<concepts.md>) = definitional

            - [maxims](<maxims.md>) = core principles / practical rules of conduct ‚Äî or [directives](<directives.md>).
            - [Q](<Q.md>) What is missing from this framework?[*]([Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>))
        - #[FN](<FN.md>) use [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way.
            - #[FN](<FN.md>) [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) are at risk of the same issues encountered by file-folder organizational systems. 
                - "Is this a "this" or a "that"?"

        - #[FN](<FN.md>) accurate and precise category naming is more robust than metaphor or mythology naming.
