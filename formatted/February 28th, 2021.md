        - [Q](<Q.md>) How do you manage the problem of community fragmentation?
            - i.e. as similar communities with similar missions form, how do you allocate your attention?
                - The potential future issue that I see is one of re-work. And spreading ideas too-thin.
                    - The collective model somewhat relies on a minimum threshold of engagement that increases as the diversity of topics widens. 
                        - More diverse range of questions and topics = more engagement and members required for meaningful convergence on related topics.
        - #[N](<N.md>) [maxims](<maxims.md>) are practical and easily communicated distillations of knowledge.
            - They serve to summarize and crystallize a piece of wisdom.
            - [I](<I.md>) Collecting [maxims](<maxims.md>) central to a domain might be helpful for mapping the territory of knowledge.
            - [Q](<Q.md>) Are [mental models](<mental models.md>) maxims?
                - I think many could be considered maxims. The format is similar. 
                - I like the term "maxim" better. It feels less trendy, carrying less baggage from modern use and discussion.
                - While many mental models might be considered maxims, going the other way feels kinda awkward...
                    - [Q](<Q.md>) Is "a watched pot never boils" a mental model?
                        - Feels less so. 
                        - Maxims feel more proverbial than mental models.
                            - [I](<I.md>) Maxims may encompass both mental models and proverbs. 
                                - [maxims](<maxims.md>) feels less religiously charged than [proverbs](<proverbs.md>) 
                                - #[N](<N.md>) The purpose of my [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) / knowledge base is to facilitate the collection and creation of proverbial wisdom. [*]([proverbs](<proverbs.md>))
            - [Q](<Q.md>) What are the differences between [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) and [maxims](<maxims.md>)?[*]([Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>))
                - [Q](<Q.md>) Is an evergreen note a maxim?
                    - And if so, 
                        - Are all maxims evergreen notes?
                            - And if so, 
                                - [Q](<Q.md>) Should [maxims](<maxims.md>) bear the `Evergreens/` namespace?
                                    - #[N](<N.md>) use [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way.
                                        - [I](<I.md>) In this sense, I am tempted to remove namespacing for evergreen notes entirely... 
            - [Q](<Q.md>) What are the differences between [maxims](<maxims.md>) and [principles](<principles.md>)?
                - I would wager: 
                    - All principles are maxims, but not all maxims are principles.
                    - Maxims can be more proverbial than principles.
                - [Q](<Q.md>) What is a principle?
            - Hierarchy:
                - Maxims (practical application of knowledge)
                - Claims (assertion of knowledge)
                - References (sources of claims and maxims)
                - Evidence (support for claims)
            - Process:
                - Collect maxims
                - Collect claims that establish/rationalize their value
                - Collect evidence that supports the claims
                - Collect resources related to the maxims or claims 
        - [I](<I.md>) [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) may be subdivided into [concepts](<concepts.md>), [claims](<claims.md>), and [maxims](<maxims.md>).
            - [concepts](<concepts.md>) = definitional
            - [claims](<claims.md>) = assertions of truths 
            - [maxims](<maxims.md>) = core principles / practical rules of conduct ‚Äî or [directives](<directives.md>).
            - [Q](<Q.md>) What is missing from this framework?[*]([Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>))
        - #[N](<N.md>) use [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) sparingly; when information can only be classified in one way.
            - #[N](<N.md>) [namespaces](<namespaces.md>) are at risk of the same issues encountered by file-folder organizational systems. 
                - "Is this a "this" or a "that"?"

    - [Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>)
        - On building a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>) structure for knowledge work...
            - [Annotations](<Annotations.md>) [Essay/A City is Not a Tree](<Essay/A City is Not a Tree.md>)
            - [Drafts](<Drafts.md>) The other day [Conor White-Sullivan](<Conor White-Sullivan.md>) tweeted out a note about [Christopher Alexander](<Christopher Alexander.md>)'s essay [Essay/A City is Not a Tree](<Essay/A City is Not a Tree.md>). I've heard Alexander's name pop up in the roamcult before (shout out to [Matt B]([cc:[[Matt Brockwell](<cc:[[Matt Brockwell.md>)]])), so I felt compelled to dive in.
                - As Alexander thinks in terms of cities, he is naturally thinking about three-dimensional environments. His thesis is that many designers plan cities using a simple tree structure...
                    - For example...
                        - A city is made up of N neighborhoods...
                            - Neighborhood 1 contains each of the following...
                                - School district A
                                - Commercial district B
                                - Emergency area C
                            - Each of School district A, Commercial district B, and Emergency area C are wholly contained within Neighborhood 1.
                    - This example is a simple tree ‚Äî each node has one single parent node
                        - [N](<N.md>) [Trees]([tree](<tree.md>))' structures can have many branches and levels, but they always follow the same maxim: each node has one and only one parent.
                - However, cities are much more complicated than trees ‚Äî in reality, they are [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>)s. In a semi-lattice, each node can have multiple parents. In this sense a semi-lattice is a more complex graph object than a tree.
                    - [N](<N.md>) [Semi-lattices]([semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>)) are a type of graph, best conceptualized as layers. However, unlike a tree, objects contained within each layer can have multiple relationships with the layer above (i.e., multiple parens).
                        - **[Image](<Image.md>):**
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FWqDTXlkODx.jpeg?alt=media&token=db6e3bda-fd27-48b8-83ed-88d0908614a1)
                        - In the above image, there are four layers, each representing some "category" of data or metadata. Once way to understand the above semi-lattice and the dotted line could be...
                            - The dotted-line represents some data-object which is associated with different layers of metadata...
                            - (Layer 1) Each yellow triangle represents a single graph member (the object's creator) ‚Äî in this case, each block or page would only have one original creator
                            - (Layer 2) Each orange circle represents a daily notes page for a given day. A data object (not a reference to said object) belongs to a single date in time.
                            - (Layer 3) Each purple shape represents a Collection ‚Äî if the dotted line represents a Project then the project would be associated with three separate collections...
                            - (Layer 4) Each blue blob represents a concept (or a group of concepts) ‚Äî if the dotted line again represents a project, then via the collections (layer 3), the project is associated with various concepts.
                                - It is important to note here that some concepts map to multiple collections (and therefore in a [nodal view](((jId9rciJf))) would have multiple parents!)
                - My initial thoughts on how we can use the idea of a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>) is as a mechanism to capture and understand the complexity of the knowledge in this graph (and all graphs...)
                    - We've explored various note mythologies and types, discussed explicit and implicit levels of maturity, gone back and forth on the usage of block-level versus page-level information. Through most of this, the idea has been to come to rational categories.
                        - While this is helpful for managing [complexity](<complexity.md>), rationalizing categories and their sub-components inevitably reduces the richness of information.
                    - If I were to offer a tentative recommendation of how we could utilize the conceptual framework of a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>), it would be to begin thinking about  different layers of data and meta-data.
                        - A few layers of interest might be....
                            - Node-type: block versus page
                            - Zettel note type: ["N"-notes](<"N"-notes.md>) versus [literature notes](<literature notes.md>) versus [permanent notes](<permanent notes.md>)
                            - Synthesis note type: context versus observation/evidence versus proposition/claim/notion versus synthesis
                            - Level of collaboration: individual thought versus community curation versus community driven
                            - Collection membership: Notetaking versus Networked Thought versus Spaced Repetition versus ...
                            - Concept relationships: notetaking versus networked thought versus spaced repetition versus ...
                        - The layers are quite literally infinite, so some rationalization is most **definitely** required.
                    - ...
                - Calling it for the evening, but looking forward to exploring the idea of a [semi-lattice](<semi-lattice.md>) and its multitude of [layers](<layers.md>) in the future
    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>)
    - [Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)
        - [Q](<Q.md>) How do you manage the problem of community fragmentation?
    - #[Change Log](<Change Log.md>)
