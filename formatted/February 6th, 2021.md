        - Drafting: [Summary/of maturity of notes](<Summary/of maturity of notes.md>)
            - "Summary — {{word-count}}"
        - Meta-discussion on: "Drafting: [Summary/of maturity of notes](<Summary/of maturity of notes.md>)"
            - How would we describe this type of note? Is it a collection or a summary or a community note or an evergreen or a...?
        - Thinking on objectives and the relationship to mythology
            - Mythologies are so often chosen based on the type of work we're trying to do
            - Tending a "mind garden," where the user is "growing" their thoughts inevitably leads to a series of notes related to gardening: `seedlings` →`buddings` → `evergreens`.
            - Likewise, Nicolas Luhmann's use of [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) directly translated to his naming of `fleeting` → `literature` → `permanent` notes
                - `fleeting` notes were __impermanent__ — Luhmann would literally throw them away — and fleeting aptly captures this nature
                - `literature` notes summarized the academic literature he was reading
                - `permanent` notes made it into the actual slipbox and became a __permanent__ part of Luhmann's "second brain"
            - The questions I keep coming back to regarding our ([Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>)'s) approach to an external and community knowledge repository are:
                - [Q](<Q.md>) Is the current mythology we're using (`fleeting` → `literature` → `evergreen`) really appropriate for our objectives?
                - Extending this question further...
                - [Q](<Q.md>) What is the objective and organizing principle for out [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)? Are we building a zettelkasten in any traditional sense?
                - Pondering these two questions...
                - [Q](<Q.md>) Should [Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>) define a new classification system for atomic units of knowledge that is better oriented towards our objective?
            - While this may seem like a distraction from some of our core goals, it seems like such a **fundamental** principle of our experiment here, that I like it is important to get right.
                - After experimenting now for nearly two weeks, I realize that I don't have a great idea of what types of content would flow into the [categories](((Yv5sA1mwk))) we're defined.
                - Additionally, [I don't think that our sole (or even main) goal](((kVRA_E03u))) is to build a [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) on collaboration in Roam.
                    - A zettelkasten is a database that accrues knowledge over time, along whatever lines of inquiry are the current focus, and is leveraged to generate content.
                    - Collecting our learnings as we go is critical — there is no doubt about this. However, the need to share these learnings with the outside world necessitates a much greater level of refinement that the zettelkasten gets us to.
                - Rather, I suspect that key objective is synthesizing the learnings from our experiments within the graph and the research we bring in from the outside. In this context, the distinct between `fleeting`, `literature`, & `evergreen` notes becomes blurry. Layering on ideas such as [maturity](<maturity.md>), [curation](<curation.md>), [collections](<collections.md>), and [creative projects](<creative projects.md>) further muddies the waters.
            - [Joel Chan](<Joel Chan.md>) has a new paper out that describes a new classification of notes that may be more appropriate.
                - Thanks to [cc:[[Jason Griffing](<cc:[[Jason Griffing.md>)]] for pointing me towards said paper!
            - [Joel's]([Joel Chan](<Joel Chan.md>)) paper outlines 4 note types...

                - The ladder of complexity rises from...
                    - `context` — passages, highlights, examples from the graph
                    - to `observations` — summaries of what the context is and what it indicates
                    - to `synthesis` — atomic ideas drawing on context & observations, ultimately helping to answer research questions
                    - to `questions` — open research questions (answered or to be answered)
            - Looking at the pros and cons of adopting a new mythology and structure...
                - Pros
                    - Orients our exploration, experimentation, and ultimately synthesis around questions
                        - Similar the various `[How To](<How To.md>)` summary pages, but extending to include the whys and the whats
                    - Eliminates preconceived notions of **what** a specific type of note is and should be — allows for greater flexibility for RC to define it's own atomic terms
                    - Accommodates multiple sub-categories, enabling various scopes and levels of maturity...
                        - `context` — binary state, context exists or it does not
                        - `observation` — artifacts themselves are lightweight with binary state (they exist or they do not); no maturity is required
                        - `synthesis` — allows for the most flexibility...
                            - Scope
                                - `notes`
                                - `collections` / `outlines`
                                - `memos` / `summaries` / `public outputs`
                            - Maturity
                                - `draft` → `in review` → `accepted`
                                - `seedlings` →`buddings` → `evergreens`
                                - Each scope could even have its own maturity scale...
                        - `questions` — can be both areas for exploration, [repositories for research](((kQhvEEYk7))), or artifacts that provide the [corresponding answer](((qtz9PYEVl))).
                    - Integrates well with processes for [convergence](<convergence.md>)
                        - For instance:
                            - Processing `context` to generate `observations` and other higher-level artifacts
                            - Curating `observations` and `synthesis notes` into `synthesis memos / public outputs`
                - Cons
                    - Requires refactoring all of the notes we have already created within the graph,  adding the necessary scope and maturity
                    - Requires RC members to learn a new approach to note-taking, raising the bar to participation
                        - Counter-point: It actually clarifies [what a note is](((gqtoTh38s))), thereby lowing the bar...
                            - I don't know where I land here...
                    - ...
            - Ultimately, my preference would be to adopt a new note schema for us to use in this graph — I like the [structure Joel has proposed](((PsBKVvanv))) and believe it would support us as we tackle the tricky challenge of convergence within a community graph. **But what I really want is to hear everyone else's thoughts!**

        - On tagging curation
            - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I did some more thinking on [this piece](((oErRCR35l))) → take a look [here](((NOWabDQws)))
                - Frankly, I kept getting caught up on how to distinguish between the various pieces of content we're putting into the graph.
                    - More specifically, I can't quite understand the difference between how everyone defines evergreen notes versus fleeting.
                    - I keep transferring my personal definition onto the graph here, which does not align with yours (and with a lot of others in the graph)
                - Ultimately I proposed a new approach to categorizing and structuring our notes (and all other work) — hopefully its at least a helpful thought piece to spur come convergence around how we (RC) take notes here...
                - p.s. — your question on "What is a community note? How is it different from an evergreen note?" is a good example of where I think the new structure could dispel **a lot** of ambiguity that exists at current...
