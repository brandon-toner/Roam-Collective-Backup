        - Don't delete stuff
        - Don't write in other people's daily notes sections
        - Use judgement when making edits in the common spaces — reach out if you are not sure.

- [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I've got much the same opinion as [you](((kf11cjKz3))). I'm not aware of a way to change user preferences and even if there was one it would be JS and need to be enabled by the user which defeats the purpose.
