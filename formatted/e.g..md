- When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [Concept handles, after Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5vA4vw86DKNq22xt6pRWhumeRmSzwV6hxRHE)). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develops ideas in notes over time and improve the “APIs,” you’ll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees ([e.g.](<e.g..md>)
