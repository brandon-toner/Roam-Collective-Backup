            - "#[FN](<../FN.md>) Writing [fleeting notes](<../fleeting notes.md>) in context, rather than in a designated location reduces the [friction](<../friction.md>) of capturing them, and helps to preserve [context](<../context.md>). [zettelkasten](<../zettelkasten.md>) [Tips](<../Tips.md>)"
            - "#[FN](<../FN.md>) Strategic and intentional use of [conventions](<../conventions.md>), improves the ratio of [signal](<../signal.md>) to [noise](<../noise.md>) by promoting [clarity](<../clarity.md>) and [order](<../order.md>). [*](((io7qOh0kA)))"
        - Structured Thinking
            - "#[FN](<../FN.md>) The use of [block-level tags](<../block-level tags.md>) to explicitly label elements of thinking can help to facilitate more scientific and analytical thinking."

        - Rediscovery
            - "[FN](<../FN.md>) The use of [block-level tags](<../block-level tags.md>) in combination with [key words](<../key words.md>) facilitates a stronger conversation that transcends the "now" -- extends across time."
            - "[FN](<../FN.md>) A users planned method of [information retrieval](<../information retrieval.md>) will impact all of the [knowledge](<../knowledge.md>) [structure](<../structure.md>)s they prefer using"

            - "#[FN](<../FN.md>) CSS for [block-level tags](<../block-level tags.md>) should allow for easy [parsing](<../parsing.md>) of the constituent parts; adding visuals cues allows for easier and more rapid processing of block contents."
            - "#[FN](<../FN.md>) Writing [fleeting notes](<../fleeting notes.md>) in context, rather than in a designated location reduces the [friction](<../friction.md>) of capturing them, and helps to preserve [context](<../context.md>). [zettelkasten](<../zettelkasten.md>) [Tips](<../Tips.md>)"
            - "#[FN](<../FN.md>) The selection of which [block-level tags](<../block-level tags.md>) are implemented as graph [conventions](<../conventions.md>) should be determined by how users may want to filter/query data."
