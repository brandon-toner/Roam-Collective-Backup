- One of the [implicit](<implicit.md>) differences between these [two tag types](((loZtX8kki))) — [block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>) and [section tags](<section tags.md>) —  is their [maturity](<maturity.md>).

- [N](<N.md>) [Block-level tags]([block-level tags](<block-level tags.md>)) tags can effectively increase the [signal-to-noise ratio](<signal-to-noise ratio.md>) by proactively parsing out [mature]([maturity](<maturity.md>))

- Rather, I suspect that key objective is synthesizing the learnings from our experiments within the graph and the research we bring in from the outside. In this context, the distinct between `fleeting`, `literature`, & `evergreen` notes becomes blurry. Layering on ideas such as [maturity](<maturity.md>),

- When referencing a fleeting note, we’d better assign a property along with it. Concretely speaking, that’s a way to indicate the relationship between blocks which would benefit us in the future. One idea that I’ve alway thought of is that we could automatically label inner reference link with such properties in a graph view, and we could do better sense on the [maturity](<maturity.md>)
