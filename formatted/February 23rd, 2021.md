Hey people, hopefully back here today, or 2morrow, to answer stuff and help with sprints
    - [Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>) ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))
        - Ideas for [chat demo](((6Zr6IVjYs))) while reading [Chatting with Glue](<Chatting with Glue.md>)
            - First off, should thinking about styling, there should be some difference between your messages and those of others
            - Ok Chatting with Glue seems a bit out of scope for what we're trying to do here, but will see if I can fish some applicable ideas.
                - Seems relatively easy to re-create in roam the chat from other apps.
                - Bit harder to ask what the current problems with chat are, and how it could be better, knowing what we have at our disposal (graph db and co)
                - [I](<I.md>) Have different "views" of messages for chat. 
                    - See any tree of nested conversation (classic roam / reddit nesting)
                    - See last new messages
            - This led to quill.chat which I like a lot
                - "Split a conversation if someone goes off-topic. Move it if there’s a better place for it. Reply to specific questions, or start a new conversation from an idea."
                - Any message or set of message can become a new conversation, where you may add new contacts. It's a focused, new discussion.
                    - "Create a thread from any set of messages. It happens all the time, someone said something that should be in its own thread. No sweat — grab any set of messages and roll them up."
                    - I think the UI is key here. When you select multiple messages a button appears, with "start new thread" and "reply". Not sure about the latter.
                - You have a feed of incoming messages, where you can **snooze** stuff, discard or open
    - [Questions](<Questions.md>) ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) [not-populated](<not-populated.md>)
    - #[GTD Zone](<GTD Zone.md>) [not-populated](<not-populated.md>)
    - #[The Zettelkasten](<The Zettelkasten.md>) [not-populated](<not-populated.md>)
    - [Conversation](<Conversation.md>) [not-populated](<not-populated.md>)
        - [@Brandon]([~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]) Saw you added some more ideas on the roaman agora, answering tomorrow :)
        - [@Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) on [this](((pn24y17FZ)))
            - Yeah loving the block-level tags now. Using them in my own db regularly now
        - [@Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) on [bookmarks](((TiZZW_6Ig))), I'm gonna try something different actually, instead of [randomization](<randomization.md>), with the question-centric workflows I'm tinkering with
            - Basically organizing my bookmarks by what questions the topic/line of inquiry answers to, and then going back when I wanna explore that thing
                - not sure yet with the specifics of how
        - [@Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) on [chat demo](((Iz0SgiMLi)))
            - Have to admit I had thoughts about it, then totally unsure again. Will bounce back off your brainstorming session.
                - "Could exist within a side bar or elsewhere"
                    - If we think about the masonry sidebar layout or other box like designs, would it be possible to put the chat interface in one of those boxes?
                        - Roam-render?
                        - Iframe?
                        - I know very little about web dev and roam plugin dev
                - "Could add a reply / thread feature (imagining it as a button in chat)"
                    - Just having a reply button is the biggest reason I personally want this, even if it's just that feature in a multiuser graph.
                    - Replying manually is tedious, even tough it gets much faster with the right things open in sidebar, and more keyboard shortcuts than mouse
                    - How it would work
                        - Reply button does 1 to 5, and copies the block you're replying to in the clipboard
                            - maybe you could have settings to choose a customizable reply alias (`[re](UID)`) for every reply, or doing your own
                    - The steps to automate
                        1. Copy block of what you wanna reply to
                        2. Go to your conversation section
                        3. /Alias
                        4. @WhoYouAreReplyingTo as alias
                        5. enter @name link
                        6. /Alias
                        7. write alias
                        8. Paste reference
                        9. Finally write message
                - "There are other ways this could be organized"
                    - We could do [quill-like](((1wWMSL_LN))) thread based messaging
                        - 1. UI (thinking this would in a third sidebar, not same UI than roam)
                            - To create a new conversation, click on "New conversation", add contacts, and write first message. Eventually have a convo title
                            - Conversation view
                                - This is like a slack channel, you can just write new messages, they're added to the bottom.
                                - Reply button
                                    - adds a new message like the others, but with some little banner at the top, with "replying to ...".
                                        - When you hover over the banner, you get a preview of what you're replying to, and can click it
                                    - Or could just be aliasing as we do here, but automatic
                                - Create new conversation from a set of messages
                                    - Select them with mouse
                                    - "New conversation" button appears as you select and stays
                                        - **[Image](<Image.md>):**
                                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FnuKsLXq7Lh.png?alt=media&token=8b988f4f-adb5-4075-8309-9d1f3b14c283)
                                    - Clicking it makes you start a new conversation from [scratch](((eCxR1J0B0)))
                                        - Contacts from the messages you selected are there by default, but you can remove some and add others
                                - Could be cool to have trees. Indentation and all that. 
                                    - Can also get quite overwhelming fast in a chat context. Could have a limit on levels of indentation
                            - Conversations list view
                                - Different from the feed view, which chronologicaly shows you new messages (or at least first chars of it)
                                - Here you see all your threads. When one is inactive you can discard it.
                                - If you prefer async, focusing on one thread of conversation at a time, at the right time
                            - Feed view
                                - Displays all your last messages, click on one and it switches to conversation view, focusing on the message from notif
                                - Option to mark as read (switches tag) or snooze to resurface later
                        - 2. Archive Structure
                            - "To create a new conversation, click on "New conversation", add contacts, and write first message. Eventually have a convo title"
                                - Parent block has the people in the conversation, and starts the feed with roam-inter or whatever
                                - Child block is the first message
                            - "Reply button"
                                - [did you mean](((RIYyXKQa-))) a block ref of the reply is inserted below what you're replying to? If so I agree
                                - Could have a reply attribute. Good to differentiate stuff, especially if people start indenting things
                                    - **[`reply](<`reply.md>):** ((block ref))`
                            - "Clicking it makes you start a new conversation from [scratch](((eCxR1J0B0)))"
                                - New parent block
                                - First children are block-refs to original messages from previous thread
                                    - Maybe convert to text and alias. Edit the text if necessary, but keep the reference to the original.
                                - Ok so here come the first structure issues. This all works if it's in one graph with multiple users, but in cross-db chat block-refs can be an issue. 
                                    - If you get added to a convo that block refs something from another convo you were not in, you don't have the original block
                                        - This could just be solved by turning a block-ref to text when someone wasn't part of the discussion that produced it before
                            - How do you make this work cross-db?
                                - Well for the infra side we don't know yet, but structurally seems pretty obvious
                                - Just send over the archives pages, and make sure blockrefs resolve correctly. Also every conversation member needs to have the app functioning to render the archive, of course.
                                - For the member pages/names, you should just choose your chat name when joining the app, which creates a page for you, a variable in the app, and will be used in parent block metadata
                - Some more arguments for [quill-like chat](((1wWMSL_LN)))
                    - It's adaptable. Seems like that structure would work for multiuser or cross-db graphs.
                        - I had cross-db in mind there. Some more details to make it multiuser graph compatible
                            - When opening the app you have to select yourself from the members list to see your "activity feed". We expect people to choose their own name, but since it's multiuser, there's no private discussion anyway.
                                - Same thing as DNP conventions. Only write under your name.
                    - Different views, same archive :)
                    - Well that's all I got. Thinking the demo could just be showing the archive structure, plus some clear-enough digital drawing
                    - Let me know what you think about it, if this is a model that interests you, etc etc
                        - Seems to me like it's cool enough to get people interested, but with a plausible data model/structure, and not too out of reach technically
                            - Afterward it can even be simplified down to the essentials, making it easier to build a functioning chat plugin relatively fast. 
                    - And last note, sorry for dumping these huge walls of text. I work by bursts of inspiration!

        2. [@Peter]([@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]) — FYI when running the DNP Header template, it needs to be done as a **smartblock** to properly render some of the components. 

PS: great work running that!

        - Perhaps a bit of confirmation (for what its worth) [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]][*]([Feedback](<Feedback.md>))
            - The clarity/onboarding you have built in here is astounding, particularly when you compare with the earlier iterations.
            - One of the most difficult parts of creating a digital space for collaboration and a community is directing attention where necessary. 
                - The left-sidebar 🥳!
            - What's hilarious, and informative, is its giving me some early 90s community forum vibes with a well thought out community. 
                - Users/Participants will surely come away with the impression: "The answer to my question must be in here!" because it is so well structure. 
                - Amazing.
            - Just wanted to make sure that this works continues without praise - not that coming from me is all that special, but it still must be said.
        - An additional piece of [[[Feedback](<[[Feedback.md>): [Suggestions](<Suggestions.md>)]] [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] regarding the Daily Notes Protocol
            - In my experience, using the daily notes page as a "dashboard" platform for users is GREAT. However, given that I am part of numerous multiplayer graphs, and having used Roam for some time now, it is my belief (not scientific, but well founded) that the quantity of queries being populated on the daily notes page can overwhelm the graph eventually. 
                - For example, my large database, 9000+ pages and nearly 700 queries has a stutter. If I actively filter OUT `[query](<query.md>)` via a global filter, my database speeds up dramatically.
                    - Even as I write this, focused on just my blocks, there is a significant stutter which I don't see on ANY of my other graphs that I work on - and I have a brand new M1 mac that screams. Roam Portal, for example, is no issue rendering 100,000 blocks in the 3D visualizer.  
                - This is belief is not without arguments against it, given that some folks indicate little difference in performance between activating and deactivating the global filter. 
                    - However, Rob Haisfield and Viktor (just to name two) have quite significant database slowdowns. 
            - Take these opinions with some healthy skepticism, but I just thought I would mention it given the trend I see here. I have moved all my clients - especially the large teams - away from putting "temporary" queries up. It's one thing to have a dashboard page (such as on our directory pages) which house a set of queries. But it is another to have several on EVERY DNP for the next year. 
        - **Instructions:** __Block reference blocks from elsewhere in the graph & nest comments underneath them__
