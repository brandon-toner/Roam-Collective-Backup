Hey people, hopefully back here today, or 2morrow, to answer stuff and help with sprints
    - [Scratchpad](<Scratchpad.md>) ((Use this as scrap paper. A place to jot down you ideas))
        - Ideas for [chat demo](((6Zr6IVjYs))) while reading [Chatting with Glue](<Chatting with Glue.md>)
            - First off, should thinking about styling, there should be some difference between your messages and those of others
            - Ok Chatting with Glue seems a bit out of scope for what we're trying to do here, but will see if I can fish some applicable ideas.
                - Seems relatively easy to re-create in roam the chat from other apps.
                - Bit harder to ask what the current problems with chat are, and how it could be better, knowing what we have at our disposal (graph db and co)
                - [I](<I.md>) Have different "views" of messages for chat. 
                    - See any tree of nested conversation (classic roam / reddit nesting)
                    - See last new messages
            - This led to quill.chat which I like a lot
                - "Split a conversation if someone goes off-topic. Move it if there‚Äôs a better place for it. Reply to specific questions, or start a new conversation from an idea."
                - Any message or set of message can become a new conversation, where you may add new contacts. It's a focused, new discussion.
                    - "Create a thread from any set of messages.¬†It happens all the time, someone said something that should be in its own thread. No sweat ‚Äî grab any set of messages and roll them up."
                    - I think the UI is key here. When you select multiple messages a button appears, with "start new thread" and "reply". Not sure about the latter.
                - You have a feed of incoming messages, where you can **snooze** stuff, discard or open

        - [@Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) on [this](((pn24y17FZ)))
            - Yeah loving the block-level tags now. Using them in my own db regularly.
        - [@Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) on [bookmarks](((TiZZW_6Ig))), I'm gonna try something different actually, instead of [randomization](<randomization.md>), with the question-centric workflows I'm tinkering with
            - Basically organizing my bookmarks by what questions the topic/line of inquiry answers to, and then going back when I wanna explore that thing
                - not sure yet with the specifics of how
        - [@Charles]([@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]) on [chat demo](((Iz0SgiMLi)))
            - Have to admit I had thoughts about it, then totally unsure again. Will bounce back off your brainstorming session.
                - "Could exist within a side bar or elsewhere"
                    - If we think about the masonry sidebar layout or other box like designs, would it be possible to put the chat interface in one of those boxes?
                        - Roam-render?
                        - Iframe?
                        - I know very little about web dev and roam plugin dev
                - "Could add a reply / thread feature (imagining it as a button in chat)"
                    - Just having a reply button is the biggest reason I personally want this, even if it's just that feature in a multiuser graph.
                    - Replying manually is tedious, even tough it gets much faster with the right things open in sidebar, and more keyboard shortcuts than mouse
                    - How it would work
                        - Reply button does 1 to 5, and copies the block you're replying to in the clipboard
                            - maybe you could have settings to choose a customizable reply alias (`[re](UID)`) for every reply, or doing your own
                    - The steps to automate
                        1. Copy block of what you wanna reply to
                        2. Go to your conversation section
                        3. /Alias
                        4. @WhoYouAreReplyingTo as alias
                        5. enter @name link
                        6. /Alias
                        7. write alias
                        8. Paste reference
                        9. Finally write message

            - What's hilarious, and informative, is its giving me some early 90s community forum vibes with a well thought out community. 
                - Users/Participants will surely come away with the impression: "The answer to my question must be in here!" because it is so well structure. 
                - Amazing.
            - Just wanted to make sure that this works continues without praise - not that coming from me is all that special, but it still must be said.
