            - In summary: I really believe in the idea of an agora on a roam graph, since it's already booming on twitter, but not sure it's the best way to manage an actual dependency graph.
                - I think the ideal would be a clean and minimalist dependency graph as a stream, sent to the roaman agora where all the discussion happens.
            - "A place to collate ideas & influence related to Roam Games"
                - Beyond the roam games, a place to collate ideas and influences for roamcult collaboration
                    - Design, UI, onboarding, ux
                    - Code, functionality
                    - Workflows and systems using features and plugins
            - For the [Roam Games](<Roam Games.md>) I think it could be valuable to have a focused and curated database, structured in the same way, that makes it easy and clear to see submissions and dependencies.
                - Because when you start discussing about everything, it can go on and on and be confusing for people who just wanna catch up with existing submissions
                - Also this lightweight, clean and maybe specially structured db would make it easier for the roam team to distribute rewards
                - **actually**: if the submissions are pretty clean and have a consistent structure and are not too tightly linked to the discussions, they could be part of the larger roaman agora, and be exported to some website or another graph for ease of access to that info.
                    - totally possible by extending roam-inter, just need to parse and convert the blocks correctly
            - "DNP for live conversation"
                - I'm just getting familiar with conventions here, but this is really great for conversation! I don't know if it should be in the dependency graph, but I think it could replace a big part of what roam-cult does on Twitter.
                    - Of course twitter would stay there for updates, news, getting the word out, etc, but just talking deep and solving problems seems more fitting in a graph.
            - Agreed on conventions (nesting, dependencies, etc)
            - "SmartBlocks & Templates"
                - This gets me thinking about how we could reduce friction as much as possible, to really get every contributor on this.
                - Maybe you could have some sort of roamgames plugin.
                    - Get a roam inter feed of submissions. On roamgames page, nested under daily page link (some sort of notification)
                    - Then for sending submissions, a smartblock that starts a roam-inter stream, and puts below the standard submission template
                        - for discussions it would be similar
                    - I was imagining a send button, but roam inter sends automatically.
                - Since this is most likely gonna be inaccessible to many in the short term (roam-inter is very hacky), we'd need something else too
                    - roam template on the shared graph, and a page with instructions (write on your page, etc)

            - # Mission Statement
                Technically the agora was invented in Ancient Greece, but it feels surprisingly at home in modern Roam.
                Just as the agora was at the center of public life in Greece, our hope for **The Roaman Agora** is for it to be a meeting place for the roamcult. A forum for us to meet and discuss ideas, all while leveraging the power of a multiplayer graph. [*](((kDLzIzdBc)))
                Over time, the intention is to build a dependency graph charting the exchange of ideas and influence through collaboration and conversation. The initial focus will be around Roam Games, but we envision The Agora serving as a meeting place to find interesting ideas and potential collaborators.
            - # Building on the work of [Roam Collective](<Roam Collective.md>)
