- It's been particularly interesting to me the level of [flow state](<flow state.md>)

- Agree with [this](((0kuQY9q7f))). If I had to get to complete evergreen note on first pass, that would be FAR too arduous. I like an iterative and free process, to optimize for [inspired action](<inspired action.md>) and [flow state](<flow state.md>)
